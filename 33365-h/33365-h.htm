<p><span class="bold">CERARGYRITE,<a name="ar1" id="ar1"></a></span> a mineral species consisting of silver chloride;
an important ore of silver. The name cerargyrite is a Greek form
(from <span class="grk" title="keras">&#954;&#941;&#961;&#945;&#962;</span>, horn, and <span class="grk" title="argyros">&#7940;&#961;&#947;&#965;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span>, silver) of the older name
hornsilver, which was used by K. Gesner as far back as 1565.
The chloro-bromide and bromide of silver were also included
under this term until they were distinguished chemically in
1841 and 1842, and described under the names embolite and
bromargyrite (or bromyrite) respectively; the chloride then
came to be distinguished as chlorargyrite, though the name
cerargyrite is often now applied to this alone. Chloro-bromo-iodide
of silver has also been recognized as a mineral and called
iodembolite. All these are strikingly alike in appearance and
general characters, differing essentially only in chemical composition,
and it would seem better to reserve the name cerargyrite
for the whole group, using the names chlorargyrite (AgCl),
embolite (Ag(Cl, Bl)), bromargyrite (AgBr) and iodembolite
(Ag(Cl, Br, I)) for the different isomorphous members of the
group. They are cubic in crystallization, with the cube and the
octahedron as prominent forms, but crystals are small and
usually indistinct; there is no cleavage. They are soft (H = 2½)
and sectile to a high degree, being readily cut with a knife
like horn. With their resinous to adamantine lustre and their
translucency they also present somewhat the appearance of horn;
hence the name hornsilver. The colour varies somewhat with the
chemical composition, being grey or colourless in chlorargyrite,
greenish-grey in embolite and bromargyrite, and greenish-yellow
to orange-yellow in iodembolite. On exposure to light the
colour quickly darkens. The specific gravity also varies with the
composition: for the pure chloride it is 5.55, and the highest
recorded for an iodembolite is 6.3.</p>

<p>The hornsilvers all occur under similar conditions and are often
associated together; they are found in metalliferous veins with
native silver and ores of silver, and are usually confined to the
upper oxidized parts of the lodes. They are important ores of
silver (the pure chloride contains 75.3% of silver), and have been
extensively mined at several places in Chile, also in Mexico, and
at Broken Hill in New South Wales. The chloride and chloro-bromide
have been found in several Cornish mines, but never
in very large amounts.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CERBERUS,<a name="ar2" id="ar2"></a></span> in Greek mythology, the dog who guarded the
entrance to the lower world. He allowed all to enter, but
seized those who attempted to escape. According to Hesiod
(<i>Theog.</i> 311), he was a fifty-headed monster with a fearful bark,
the offspring of Typhon and Echidna. He was variously
represented with one, two or (usually) three heads, often with
the tail of a snake or with snakes growing from his head or twined
round his body. One of the tasks imposed upon Heracles was to
fetch Cerberus from below to the upper world, a favourite subject
of ancient vase-paintings.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CERDIC<a name="ar3" id="ar3"></a></span> (d. 534), founder of the West Saxon kingdom, is
described as an ealdorman who in 495 landed with his son Cynric
in Hampshire, where he was attacked at once by the Britons.
Nothing more is heard of him until 508, when he defeated the
Britons with great slaughter. Strengthened by fresh arrivals
of Saxons, he gained another victory in 519 at Certicesford, a
spot which has been identified with the modern Charford, and in
this year took the title of king. Turning westward, Cerdic appears
to have been defeated by the Britons in 520 at Badbury or Mount
Badon, in Dorset, and in 527 yet another fight with the Britons
is recorded. His last work was the conquest of the Isle of Wight,
probably in the interest of some Jutish allies. All the sovereigns
of England, except Canute, Hardicanute, the two Harolds and
William the Conqueror, are said to be descended from Cerdic.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CERDONIANS,<a name="ar4" id="ar4"></a></span> a Gnostic sect, founded by Cerdo, a Syrian,
who came to Rome about 137, but concerning whose history
little is known. They held that there are two first causes&mdash;the
perfectly good and the perfectly evil. The latter is also the
creator of the world, the god of the Jews, and the author of the
Old Testament. Jesus Christ is the son of the good deity; he
was sent into the world to oppose the evil; but his incarnation,
and therefore his sufferings, were a mere appearance. Regarding
the body as the work of the evil deity, the Cerdonians formed a
moral system of great severity, prohibiting marriage, wine and
the eating of flesh, and advocating fasting and other austerities.
Most of what the Fathers narrate of Cerdo&rsquo;s tenets has probably
been transferred to him from his famous pupil Marcion, like
whom he is said to have rejected the Old Testament and the
New, except part of Luke&rsquo;s Gospel and of Paul&rsquo;s Epistles. (See

general, a near relative of the emperor Vespasian. He is first

defeated (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 61) by Boadicea. Eight years later
he played an important part in the capture of Rome by the
supporters of Vespasian. In 70 he put down the revolt of
Civilis (<i>q.v.</i>). In 71, as governor of Britain, where he had as
a subordinate the famous Agricola, he inflicted severe defeats
upon the Brigantes, the most powerful of the tribes of Britain.
Tacitus says that he was a bold soldier rather than a careful
general, and preferred to stake everything on the issue of a
single engagement. He possessed natural eloquence of a kind
that readily appealed to his soldiers. His loyalty towards his
superiors was unshakable.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CERES,<a name="ar6" id="ar6"></a></span> an old Italian goddess of agriculture. The name
probably means the &ldquo;creator&rdquo; or &ldquo;created,&rdquo; connected with
<i>crescere</i> and <i>creare</i>. But when Greek deities were introduced
into Rome on the advice of the Sibylline books (in 495 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>,
on the occasion of a severe drought), Demeter, the Greek goddess
of seed and harvest, whose worship was already common in
Sicily and Lower Italy, usurped the place of Ceres in Rome,
or rather, to Ceres were added the religious rites which the Greeks
paid to Demeter, and the mythological incidents which originated
with her. At the same time the cult of Dionysus and Persephone
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Liber and Libera</a></span>) was introduced. The rites of Ceres were
Greek in language and form. Her priestesses were Italian Greeks
and her temple was Greek in its architecture and built by Greek
artists. She was worshipped almost exclusively by plebeians,
and her temple near the Circus Maximus was under the care of
the plebeian aediles, one of whose duties was the superintendence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page761" id="page761"></a>761</span>
of the corn-market. Her chief festivals were the <i>ludi Cereris</i>
or <i>Cerealia</i> (more correctly, <i>Cerialia</i>), games held annually from
April 12-19 (Ovid, <i>Fasti</i>, iv. 392 ff.); a second festival,
in August, to celebrate the reunion of Ceres and Proserpine,
in which women, dressed in white, after a fast of nine days
offered the goddess the first-fruits of the harvest (Livy xxii. 56);
and the <i>Jejunium Cereris</i>, a fast also introduced (191 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) by
command of the Sibylline books (Livy xxvi. 37), at first held
only every four years, then annually on the 4th of October. In
later times Ceres was confused with Tellus. (See also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Demeter</a></span>.)</p>

34,195. It was rebuilt after a great earthquake in 1731, and has
a considerable agricultural trade. In 1503 the Spaniards under
Gonzalo de Cordoba defeated the French under the duc de
Nemours below the town&mdash;a victory which made the kingdom
of Naples into a Spanish province in Italy. Cerignola occupies
the site of Furfane, a station on the Via Traiana between
Canusium and Herdoniae.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CERIGOTTO,<a name="ar8" id="ar8"></a></span> called locally <span class="sc">Lius</span> (anc. <i>Aegilia</i> or <i>Ogylos</i>; mod.
Gr. officially <i>Antikythera</i>), an island of Greece, belonging to the
Ionian group, and situated between Cythera (Cerigo) and Crete,
about 20 m. from each. Some raised beaches testify to an
upheaval in comparatively recent times. With an area of about
10 sq. m. it supports a population of about 300, who are mainly
Cretan refugees, and in favourable seasons exports a quantity of
good wheat. It was long a favourite resort of Greek pirates. It is
famous for the discovery in 1900, close to its coast, of the wreck
of an ancient ship with a cargo of bronze and marble statues.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CERINTHUS<a name="ar9" id="ar9"></a></span> (c. <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 100), an early Christian heretic, contemporary
with the closing years of the apostle John, who,
according to the well-known story of Polycarp, reported by
Irenaeus (iii. 3) and twice recorded in Eusebius (<i>Hist. Eccl.</i>
iii. 28, iv. 14), made a hasty exit from a bath in Ephesus on
learning that Cerinthus was within. Other early accounts agree
in making the province of Asia the scene of his activity, and
Hippolytus (<i>Haer</i>. vii. 33) credits him with an Egyptian training.
There can be no truth in the notice given by Epiphanius (<i>Haer</i>.
xxviii. 4) that Cerinthus had in earlier days at Jerusalem led
the judaizing opposition against Paul.</p>

<p>The difficulty of defining Cerinthus&rsquo;s theological position is
due not only to the paucity of our sources but to the fact that the
witness of the two principal authorities, Irenaeus (1. 26, iii. 11)
and Hippolytus (<i>Syntagma</i>), does not agree. Further, Irenaeus
himself in one passage fails to distinguish between Cerinthian
and Valentinian doctrines. It would appear, however, that
Cerinthus laid stress on the rite of circumcision and on the
observance of the Sabbath. He taught that the world had been
made by angels, from one of whom, the god of the Jews, the
people of Israel had received their Law, which was not perfect.
The only New Testament writing which he accepted was a
mutilated Gospel of Matthew. Jesus was the offspring of Joseph
and Mary, and on him at the baptism descended the Christ,<a name="fa1a" id="fa1a" href="#ft1a"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
revealing the hitherto unknown Father, and endowing him with
miraculous power. This Christ left Jesus again before the Passion,
and the resurrection of Jesus was still in the future. Together
with these somewhat gnostic ideas, Cerinthus, if we may trust
the notices of Gaius the Roman presbyter (c. 290) and Dionysius
of Alexandria (c. 340), held a violent and crude form of chiliasm.
But the chief significance of the man is his &ldquo;combination of zeal
for legal observances with bold criticism of the Law itself as a
whole and of its origin,&rdquo; which reminds us of the Clementine
<i>Recognitions</i>. Cerinthus is a blend of judaizing christian and
gnostic.</p>

<hr class="foot" /> <div class="note">

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CERIUM<a name="ar10" id="ar10"></a></span> (symbol Ce, atomic weight 140.25), a metallic
chemical element which occurs with the rare earths in the minerals
cerite, samarskite, euxenite, monazite, parisite and many
yttrium minerals. The particular earth containing cerium was
discovered by M.H. Klaproth in 1803, whilst J. Berzelius at
about the same time also examined it and came to the conclusion
that it was the oxide of a new metal, which he termed cerium.
The crude oxide of the metal is obtained from cerite, by evaporating
the mineral with strong sulphuric acid, removing excess of
acid and dissolving the residue in ice-cold water; sulphuretted
hydrogen is passed through the solution, which is then filtered,
acidified with hydrochloric acid, and precipitated as oxalate
by oxalic acid; the oxalate is then converted into oxide by
ignition. From the crude oxide so obtained (which contains
lanthanum and didymium oxides) the cerium may be separated
by conversion into its double sulphate on the addition of potassium
sulphate, the sulphates of the cerium group being insoluble
in a saturated solution of potassium sulphate. The sulphate
is subsequently boiled with water, when a basic sulphate is
precipitated. For the preparation of pure cerium compounds
see Auer v. Welsbach, <i>Monatshefte</i>, 1884, v. 508.</p>

<p>The metal was first obtained, in an impure state, by C.G.
Mosander, by fusing its chloride with sodium. W.F. Hillebrand
and T. Norton have prepared it by the electrolysis of the melted
chloride (<i>Pogg. Ann.</i>, 1875, 156, p. 466); and C. Winkler (<i>Berichte</i>,
1891, xxiv. 884) obtained it by heating the dioxide with magnesium
powder. The metal has somewhat the appearance of
iron, and has a specific gravity of 6.628, which, after melting,
is increased to 6.728. Its specific heat is 0.04479 (W.F. Hillebrand).
It is permanent in dry air, but tarnishes in moist air;
it can be hammered and rolled; it melts at 623° C. It burns
readily on heating, with a brilliant flame; and it also combines
with chlorine, bromine, iodine, sulphur, phosphorus and cyanogen.
In the case of the two former elements the combination is
accompanied by combustion of the metal. With water it is
slowly converted into the dioxide. Cold concentrated nitric
and sulphuric acids are without action on the metal, but it
reacts rapidly with dilute nitric and hydrochloric acids. The
dioxide is used in incandescent gas mantles (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lighting</a></span>).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Three oxides of cerium are known. The sesquioxide, Ce<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">3</span>, is
obtained by heating the carbonate in a current of hydrogen. It is a
bluish-green powder, which on exposure rapidly combines with the
oxygen of the air. By the addition of caustic soda to cerous salts, a
white precipitate of cerous hydroxide is formed. Cerium dioxide,
CeO<span class="su">2</span>, is produced when cerium carbonate, nitrate, sulphate or
oxalate is heated in air. It is a white or pale yellow compound,
which becomes reddish on heating. Its specific gravity is 6.739,
and its specific heat 0.0877. It is not reduced to the metallic condition
on heating with carbon. Concentrated sulphuric acid dissolves
this oxide, forming a yellowish solution and ozone. By suspending
the precipitated cerous hydroxide in water and passing chlorine
through the solution, a hydrated form of the dioxide, 2CeO<span class="su">2</span>·3H<span class="su">2</span>O, is
obtained, which is readily soluble in nitric and sulphuric acids,
forming ceric salts, and in hydrochloric acid, where it forms cerous
chloride, with liberation of chlorine. A higher hydrated oxide,
CeO<span class="su">3</span>·xH<span class="su">2</span>O, is formed by the interaction of cerous sulphate with
sodium acetate and hydrogen peroxide (Lecoq de Boisbaudran,
<i>Comptes rendus</i>, 1885, 100, p. 605).</p>

<p>Cerous chloride, CeCl<span class="su">3</span>, is obtained when the metal is burned in
chlorine; when a mixture of cerous oxide and carbon is heated in
chlorine; or by rapid heating of the dioxide in a stream of carbon
monoxide and chlorine. It is a colourless substance, which is easily
fusible. A hydrated chloride of composition 2CeCl<span class="su">3</span>·15H<span class="su">2</span>O is also
known, and is obtained when a solution of cerous oxide in hydrochloric
acid is evaporated over sulphuric acid. Double salts of
cerous chloride with stannic chloride, mercuric chloride, and platinic
chloride are also known. Cerous bromide, 2CeBr<span class="su">3</span>·3H<span class="su">2</span>O, and iodide,
CeI<span class="su">3</span>·9H<span class="su">2</span>O, are known. Cerous sulphide, Ce<span class="su">2</span>S<span class="su">3</span>, results on heating
cerium with sulphur or cerium oxide in carbon bisulphide vapour.
It is a red infusible mass of specific gravity 5.1, and is slowly
decomposed by warm water. The sulphate, Ce<span class="su">2</span>(SO<span class="su">4</span>)<span class="su">3</span>, is formed on
dissolving the carbonate in sulphuric acid, or on dissolving the basic
sulphate in sulphuric acid, in the presence of sulphur dioxide,
evaporating the solution, and drying the product obtained, at high
temperature (B. Brauner, <i>Monatshefte</i>, 1885, vi. 793). It is a white
powder of specific gravity 3.912, easily soluble in cold water. Many
hydrated forms of the sulphate are known, as are also double salts
of the sulphate with potassium, sodium, ammonium, thallium and
cadmium sulphates. Ceric fluoride, CeF<span class="su">4</span>·H<span class="su">2</span>O, is obtained when the
hydrated dioxide is dissolved in hydrofluoric acid and the solution
evaporated on the water bath (B. Brauner). The sulphate,
Ce(SO<span class="su">4</span>)<span class="su">2</span>·4H<span class="su">2</span>O, is formed when the basic sulphate is dissolved
in sulphuric acid; or when the dioxide is dissolved in dilute sulphuric
acid, and evaporated <i>in vacuo</i> over sulphuric acid. It
forms yellow crystals soluble in water; the aqueous solution on
standing gradually depositing a basic salt. Double sulphates of
composition 2Ce(SO<span class="su">4</span>)<span class="su">2</span>·2K<span class="su">2</span>SO<span class="su">4</span>·2H<span class="su">2</span>O, Ce(SO<span class="su">4</span>)<span class="su">2</span>·3(NH<span class="su">4</span>)<span class="su">2</span>SO<span class="su">4</span>·4H<span class="su">2</span>O are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page762" id="page762"></a>762</span>
known.    Nitrates of cerium have been described, as have also phosphates,
carbonates and a carbide.</p>

<p>Cerium compounds may be recognized by the red precipitate of
ceric hydroxide, which is formed when sodium hypochlorite is added
to a colourless cerous salt. For the quantitative determination of
the metal, the salts are precipitated by caustic potash, the precipitate
washed, dried and heated, and finally weighed as the dioxide.</p>

<p>The atomic weight of cerium has been determined by B. Brauner
(<i>Chem. News</i>, 1895, lxxi. 283) from the analysis of the oxalate; the
values obtained varying from 140.07 to 140.35.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CERNUSCHI, HENRI<a name="ar11" id="ar11"></a></span> (1821-1896), Italian politician and
economist, was born of wealthy parents at Milan in 1821, and
was destined for the legal profession. During his studies he
became involved in the revolutionary movement. He played a
conspicuous part in the insurrection at Milan in 1848, and also
at Rome in 1849, where he had a seat in the National Assembly.
On the collapse of the revolutionary government he was arrested
(1850), but managed to escape to France, where he engaged
in commerce and banking, became naturalized, and acquired
a large fortune. He took a prominent part in opposing the
Socialist movement, and in April 1870, having subscribed a
large sum to the funds of a committee formed to combat the
Napoleonic plebiscite, had to leave the country. In September
the formation of the Third Republic enabled him to return, but he
soon left Paris to travel in the East, whence he returned with a
fine art collection, particularly of Japanese objects. Cernuschi
is best known for his publications on financial questions, more
especially bimetallism. Of the latter he was an ardent champion,
and the word itself is commonly supposed to have originated
with him&mdash;at least in its English form it is first found in his
<i>Silver Vindicated</i> (1876). Among his other works may be
mentioned: <i>Mécanique de l&rsquo;échange</i> (1861); <i>Illusion des sociétés
coopératives</i> (1886); <i>Le Bimétallisme en Angleterre</i> (1879); <i>Le
Grand Procès de l&rsquo;Union latine</i> (1884). He died at Mentone
on the 12th of May 1896.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CERRO DE PASCO, <a name="ar13" id="ar13"></a></span>or <span class="sc">Pasco</span>, a mining town of Peru, capital
of the department of Junin, 107 m. (221 m. by rail, via Oroya)
N.E. of Lima. Pop. (1907 est.) 10,000. It is situated on the
plateau of Bombon, 14,280 ft. above sea-level, and in the midst
of one of the oldest and richest silver-mining districts of Peru.
There were 342 silver mines in this district in 1890, and at the
end of the 19th century the average annual output since the
discovery of the mines in 1630 was estimated at 1,600,000 oz.
A decline in the silver production having set in, the American
company which had become owners of three-fourths of the
mining properties in the district turned its attention to the
extensive copper deposits there, built a railway to Oroya 83 m.
distant, another, 25 m. long, to the coal-fields of Gollarisquisga,
north of Pasco, and then erected large smelting works (in which
2500 men were regularly employed in 1907) 8 m. out of town and
4 m. from limestone beds. The railway to Oroya was completed
in 1903, the coal mine branch and smelter later on, and in 1907
the copper output was 20,152,000 &#8468; The town of Pasco is
badly built and unattractive, and is inhabited chiefly by mining
labourers and their families. Its population is increased 50% in
times of great mining activity. The name Cerro de Pasco is
that of a &ldquo;knot&rdquo; of mountains uniting the two great ranges
of the Andes at this point.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CERTALDO,<a name="ar14" id="ar14"></a></span> a town of Tuscany, Italy, in the province of
Florence, 35 m. S.S.W. by rail and 18 m. direct from the town
of Florence. Pop. (1901) town, 4552; commune, 9120. It was
the home of the family of Giovanni Boccaccio, who died and was
buried here in 1375. His house (of red brick, like the other old
houses of the town) was restored in 1823 and fitted up with old
furniture. A statue of him was erected in the principal square in
1875. The Palazzo Pretorio, or Vicariale, the residence of the
Florentine governors, recently restored to its original condition,
has a picturesque facade and court adorned with coats of arms,
and in the interior are various frescoes dating from the 13th to
the 16th century. The town as a whole is picturesque, and lies
on a hill 426 ft. above sea-level.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CERUSSITE,<a name="ar15" id="ar15"></a></span> a mineral consisting of lead carbonate (PbCO<span class="su">3</span>),
and an important ore of lead. The name (sometimes erroneously
spelt cerusite) is from the Lat. <i>cerussa</i>, &ldquo;white lead.&rdquo; &ldquo;Cerussa
nativa&rdquo; was mentioned by K. Gesner in 1565, and in 1832
F.S. Beudant applied the name céruse to the mineral, whilst the
present form, cerussite, is due to W. Haidinger (1845). Popular
names in early use were lead-spar and white-lead-ore.</p>

<p>Cerussite crystallizes in the orthorhombic system and is
isomorphous with aragonite. Like aragonite it is very frequently
twinned, the compound crystals being
pseudo-hexagonal in form. Three crystals are
usually twinned together on two faces of the prism
<i>m</i>{110}, producing six-rayed stellate groups (figs, 1
and 2) with the individual crystals intercrossing
at angles of nearly 60°. Twinning on the faces of
the prism <i>r</i>{130}, the angles of which are also
nearly 60°, produces a similar kind of grouping,
but is much less common. Crystals are of frequent
occurrence, and they usually have very bright
and smooth faces. The mineral also occurs in
compact granular masses, and sometimes in
fibrous forms. It is usually colourless or white,
sometimes grey or greenish in tint; it varies
from transparent to translucent, and has an
adamantine lustre. It is very brittle, and has a conchoidal
fracture. Hardness 3-3½; sp. gr. 6.5. A variety containing
7% of zinc carbonate, replacing lead carbonate, is known as
iglesiasite, from Iglesias in Sardinia, where it is found.</p>

<p>The mineral may be readily recognized by its characteristic
twinning, in conjunction with the adamantine lustre and high
specific gravity. It dissolves with effervescence in dilute nitric
acid. Before the blow-pipe
it fuses very readily,
and gives reactions for
lead. Cerussite occurs
in metalliferous veins in
association with galena,
and has been formed by
the action of carbonated
waters on the galena; it
is therefore found in the
upper parts of the lodes
together with other secondary minerals, such as limonite. Finely
crystallized specimens have been obtained from the Friedrichssegen
mine near Ems in Nassau, Johanngeorgenstadt in Saxony,
Mies in Bohemia, Phenixville in Pennsylvania, Broken Hill in
New South Wales, and several other localities. Delicate acicular
crystals of considerable length were found long ago in the Pentire
Glaze mine near St Minver in Cornwall. It is often found
in considerable quantities, and contains as much as 77½% of
lead.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CERUTTI, GIUSEPPE ANTONIO GIACHIMO<a name="ar16" id="ar16"></a></span> (1738-1792),
French author and politician, was born at Turin on the 13th of
June 1738. He joined the Society of Jesus and became professor
at the Jesuit college at Lyons. In 1762, in reply to the attacks
on his order, he published an <i>Apologie générale de l&rsquo;institut et de
la doctrine des Jésuites</i>, which won him much fame and some
exalted patronage; notably that of the ex-king Stanislaus of
Poland and of his grandson the dauphin. During the agitations
that preceded the Revolution Cerutti took the popular side, and
in 1788 published a pamphlet, <i>Mémoire pour le peuple français</i>,
in which in a clear and trenchant style he advocated the claims
of the <i>tiers état</i>. In May 1789 he presided over the electors of
Paris, by whom in January 1791 he was chosen member of the
administration of the department and afterwards deputy to
the Legislative Assembly. He was a friend of Mirabeau, whose
policy he supported and whose funeral oration he pronounced.
He himself died on the 3rd of February 1792. Of Cerutti&rsquo;s
literary enterprises the most interesting, and probably the most
influential, was the popular newspaper founded by him, on the
30th of September 1790, in collaboration with Rabaut Saint-Étienne
and Philippe Antoine Grouvelle. Its character and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page763" id="page763"></a>763</span>
objects are explained by its title: <i>La Feuille villageoise,
adressée chaque semaine à tous les villages de France pour les
instruire des lois, des événements, des découvertes qui interessent
tout ban citoyen, &amp;c.</i> It was continued by Grouvelle after Cerutti&rsquo;s
death, the last number appearing on the 2nd of August 1795.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CERVANTES SAAVEDRA, MIGUEL DE<a name="ar17" id="ar17"></a></span> (1547-1616), Spanish
novelist, playwright and poet, was born at Alcalá de Henares
in 1547. The attempts of biographers to provide him with an
illustrious genealogy are unsuccessful. The family history begins
with the author&rsquo;s grandfather, Juan de Cervantes (b. 1490), a
lawyer who at one time (1545-6) administered the estates of
the duke de Osuna, and resided later at Cordova, where he died
about 1555. Cervantes&rsquo; father was Rodrigo de Cervantes, an
apothecary-surgeon, who married Leonor de Cortinas in 1540 or
1541. The children of this marriage were Andrés (b. 1543),
Andrea (b. 1544), Luisa (b. 1546), Miguel, Rodrigo (b. 1550),
Magdalena (b. 1554) and Juan (of whom nothing is known
beyond the mention of him in his father&rsquo;s will).</p>

<p>The exact date of Cervantes&rsquo; birth is not recorded: he was
baptized on the 9th of October 1547, in the church of Santa
Maria la Mayor at Alcalá. There are indications that Rodrigo
de Cervantes resided at Valladolid in 1554, at Madrid in 1561, at
Seville in 1564-1565, and at Madrid from 1566 onwards. It
may be assumed that his family accompanied him, and it seems
likely that either at Valladolid or at Madrid Cervantes saw the
famous actor-manager and dramatist, Lope de Rueda, of whose
performances he speaks enthusiastically in the preface to his
plays. In 1569 a Madrid schoolmaster, Juan Lopez de Hoyos,
issued a work commemorative of Philip II.&rsquo;s third wife, Isabel
de Valois, who had died on the 3rd of October 1568. This
volume, entitled <i>Historia y relación verdadera de la enfermedad,
felicisimo tránsito y sumptuosas exequias fúnebres de la Serenisima
Reyna de Españia Doña Isabel de Valoys</i>, contains six contributions
by Cervantes: a sonnet, four <i>redondillas</i>, and an elegy.
Lopez de Hoyos introduces Cervantes as &ldquo;our dear and beloved
pupil,&rdquo; and the elegy is dedicated to Cardinal Espinosa &ldquo;in the
name of the whole school.&rdquo; It has been inferred that Cervantes
was educated by Lopez de Hoyos, but this conclusion is untenable,
for Lopez de Hoyos&rsquo; school was not opened till 1567. On the
13th of October 1568, Giulio Acquaviva reached Madrid charged
with a special mission to Philip II.; he left for Rome on the 2nd
of December, and Cervantes is supposed to have accompanied
him. This conjecture is based solely on a passage in the dedication
of the <i>Galatea</i>, where the writer speaks of having been
&ldquo;<i>camarero</i> to Cardinal Acquaviva at Rome.&rdquo; There is, however,
no reason to think that Cervantes met Acquaviva in Madrid;
the probability is that he enlisted as a supernumerary towards
the end of 1568, that he served in Italy, and there entered the
household of Acquaviva, who had been raised to the cardinalate
on the 17th of May 1570. There exists a warrant (dated
September 15, 1569) for the arrest of one Miguel de Cervantes,
who had wounded Antonio de Sigura, and had been condemned
in absence to have his right hand cut off and to be exiled from
the capital for ten years; and it has been sought to identify
the offender with the future author of <i>Don Quixote</i>. No evidence
is available. All that is known with certainty is that Cervantes
was in Rome at the end of 1569, for on the 22nd of December
of that year the fact was recorded in an official information lodged
by Rodrigo de Cervantes with a view to proving his son&rsquo;s
legitimacy and untainted Christian descent.</p>

<p>If it is difficult to say precisely when Cervantes was in
Acquaviva&rsquo;s service, it is no less difficult to say when he left it
to join the regular army. There is evidence, more or less satisfactory,
that his enlistment took place in 1570; in 1571 he was
serving as a private in the company commanded by Captain
Diego de Urbina which formed part of Miguel de Moncada&rsquo;s
famous regiment, and on the 16th of September he sailed from
Messina on board the &ldquo;Marquesa,&rdquo; which formed part of the
armada under Don John of Austria. At the battle of Lepanto
(October 7, 1571) the &ldquo;Marquesa&rdquo; was in the thickest of the
conflict. As the fleet came into action Cervantes lay below, ill
with fever; but, despite the remonstrances of his comrades,
he vehemently insisted on rising to take his share in the fighting,
and was posted with twelve men under him in a boat by the
galley&rsquo;s side. He received three gunshot wounds, two in the
chest, and one which permanently maimed his right hand&mdash;&ldquo;for
the greater glory of the right,&rdquo; in his own phrase. On the 30th
of October the fleet returned to Messina, where Cervantes went
into hospital, and during his convalescence received grants-in-aid
amounting to eighty-two ducats. On the 29th of April 1572
he was transferred to Captain Manuel Ponce de León&rsquo;s company
in Lope de Figueroa&rsquo;s regiment; he shared in the indecisive
naval engagement off Navarino on the 7th of October 1572, in
the capture of Tunis on the 10th of October 1573, and in the
unsuccessful expedition to relieve the Goletta in the autumn of
1574. The rest of his military service was spent in garrison at
Palermo and Naples, and shortly after the arrival of Don John
at Naples on the 18th of June 1575, Cervantes was granted leave
to return to Spain; he received a recommendatory letter from
Don John to Philip II., and a similar testimonial from the duke
de Sessa, viceroy of Sicily. Armed with these credentials,
Cervantes embarked on the &ldquo;Sol&rdquo; to push his claim for promotion
in Spain.</p>

<p>On the 26th of September 1575, near Les Trois Maries off the
coast of Marseilles, the &ldquo;Sol&rdquo; and its companion ships the
&ldquo;Mendoza&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Higuera&rdquo; encountered a squadron of
Barbary corsairs under Arnaut Mami; Cervantes, his brother
Rodrigo and other Spaniards were captured, and were taken as
prisoners to Algiers. Cervantes became the slave of a Greek
renegade named Dali Mami, and, as the letters found on him
were taken to prove that he was a man of importance in a
position to pay a high ransom, he was put under special
surveillance. With undaunted courage and persistence he organized
plans of escape. In 1576 he induced a Moor to guide him and
other Christian captives to Oran; the Moor deserted them on the
road, the baffled fugitives returned to Algiers, and Cervantes
was treated with additional severity. In the spring of 1577
two priests of the Order of Mercy arrived in Algiers with a sum
of three hundred crowns entrusted to them by Cervantes&rsquo;
parents; the amount was insufficient to free him, and was
spent in ransoming his brother Rodrigo. Cervantes made
another attempt to escape in September 1577, but was betrayed
by the renegade whose services he had enlisted. On being
brought before Hassan Pasha, the viceroy of Algiers, he took
the blame on himself, and was threatened with death; struck,
however, by the heroic bearing of the prisoner, Hassan remitted
the sentence, and bought Cervantes from Dali Mami for five
hundred crowns. In 1577 the captive addressed to the Spanish
secretary of state, Mateo Vazquez, a versified letter suggesting
that an expedition should be fitted out to seize Algiers; the
project, though practicable, was not entertained. In 1578
Cervantes was sentenced to two thousand strokes for sending
a letter begging help from Martín de Córdoba, governor of Oran;
the punishment was not, however, inflicted on him. Meanwhile
his family were not idle. In March 1578 his father presented
a petition to the king setting forth Cervantes&rsquo; services; the duke
de Sessa repeated his testimony to the captive&rsquo;s merits; in the
spring of 1579 Cervantes&rsquo; mother applied for leave to export
two thousand ducats&rsquo; worth of goods from Valencia to Algiers,
and on the 31st of July 1579 she gave the Trinitarian monks,
Juan Gil and Antón de la Bella, a sum of two hundred and fifty
ducats to be applied to her son&rsquo;s ransom. On his side Cervantes
was indefatigable, and towards the end of 1579 he arranged to
secure a frigate; but the plot was revealed to Hassan by Juan
Blanco de Paz, a Dominican monk, who appears to have conceived
an unaccountable hatred of Cervantes. Once more the
conspirator&rsquo;s life was spared by Hassan who, it is recorded,
declared that &ldquo;so long as he had the maimed Spaniard in safe
keeping, his Christians, ships and city were secure.&rdquo; On the
29th of May 1580 the two Trinitarians arrived in Algiers: they
were barely in time, for Hassan&rsquo;s term of office was drawing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page764" id="page764"></a>764</span>
to a close, and the arrangement of any ransom was a slow process,
involving much patient bargaining. Hassan refused to accept
less than five hundred gold ducats for his slave; the available
funds fell short of this amount, and the balance was collected
from the Christian traders of Algiers. Cervantes was already
embarked for Constantinople when the money was paid on the
19th of September 1580. The first use that he made of his
liberty was to cause affidavits of his proceedings at Algiers to be
drawn up; he sailed for Spain towards the end of October,
landed at Denia in November, and made his way to Madrid.
He signed an information before a notary in that city on the
18th of December 1580.</p>

<p>These dates prove that he cannot, as is often alleged, have
served under Alva in the Portuguese campaign of 1580: that
campaign ended with the battle of Alcántara on the 25th of
August 1580. It seems certain, however, that he visited Portugal
soon after his return from Algiers, and in May 1581 he was sent
from Thomar on a mission to Oran. Construed literally, a
formal statement of his services, signed by Cervantes on the
21st of May 1590, makes it appear that he served in the Azores
campaigns of 1582-83; but the wording of the document is
involved, the claims of Cervantes are confused with those of his
brother Rodrigo (who was promoted ensign at the Azores),
and on the whole it is doubtful if he took part in either of the
expeditions under Santa Cruz. In any case, the stories of his
residence in Portugal, and of his love affairs with a noble
Portuguese lady who bore him a daughter, are simple inventions.
From 1582-3 to 1587 Cervantes seems to have written copiously
for the stage, and in the <i>Adjunta al Parnaso</i> he mentions several
of his plays as &ldquo;worthy of praise&rdquo;; these were <i>Los Tratos de
Argel, La Numancia, La Gran Turquesa, La Batalla naval, La
Jerusalem, La Amaranta ó la de Mayo, El Bosque amoroso, La
Unica y Bizarra Ársinda</i>&mdash;&ldquo;and many others which I do not
remember, but that which I most prize and pique myself on was,
and is, one called <i>La Confusa</i> which, with all respect to as many
sword-and-cloak plays as have been staged up to the present,
may take a prominent place as being good among the best.&rdquo;
Of these only <i>Los Tratos de Argel</i> (or <i>El Trato de Argel</i>) and
<i>La Numancia</i> have survived, and, though <i>La Numancia</i> contains
many fine rhetorical passages, both plays go to prove that the
author&rsquo;s genius was not essentially dramatic. In February
1584 he obtained a licence to print a pastoral novel entitled
<i>Primera parte de la Galatea</i>, the copyright of which he sold on
the 14th of June to Blas de Robles, a bookseller at Alcalá de
Henares, for 1336 <i>reales</i>. On the 12th of December he married
Catalina de Palacios Salazar y Vozmediano of Esquivias, eighteen
years his junior. The <i>Galatea</i> was published in the spring of
1585, and is frequently said to relate the story of Cervantes&rsquo;
courtship, and to introduce various distinguished writers under
pastoral names. These assertions must be received with great
reserve. The birth of an illegitimate daughter, borne to Cervantes
by a certain Ana Francisca de Rojas, is referred to 1584, and
earlier in that same year the <i>Galatea</i> had passed the censor;
with few exceptions, the identifications of the characters in the
book with personages in real life are purely conjectural. These
circumstances, together with the internal evidence of the work,
point to the conclusion that the <i>Galatea</i> was begun and completed
before 1583. It was only twice reprinted&mdash;once at Lisbon
(1590), and once at Paris (1611)&mdash;during the author&rsquo;s lifetime;
but it won him a measure of repute, it was his favourite among
his books, and during the thirty years that remained to him he
repeatedly announced the second part which is promised conditionally
in the text. However, it is not greatly to be regretted
that the continuation was never published; though the <i>Galatea</i>
is interesting as the first deliberate bid for fame on the part of a
great genius, it is an exercise in the pseudo-classic literature
introduced into Italy by Sannazaro, and transplanted to Spain
by the Portuguese Montemõr; and, ingenious or eloquent as
the Renaissance prose-pastoral may be, its innate artificiality
stifles Cervantes&rsquo; rich and glowing realism. He himself recognized
its defects; with all his weakness for the <i>Galatea</i>, he
ruefully allows that &ldquo;it proposes something and concludes
nothing.&rdquo; Its comparative failure was a serious matter for
Cervantes who had no other resource but his pen; his plays
were probably less successful than his account of them would
imply, and at any rate play-writing was not at this time a
lucrative occupation in Spain. No doubt the death of his
father on the 13th of June 1585 increased the burden of Cervantes&rsquo;
responsibilities; and the dowry of his wife, as appears from a
document dated the 9th of August 1586, consisted of nothing
more valuable than five vines, an orchard, some household
furniture, four beehives, forty-five hens and chickens, one cock
and a crucible.</p>

<p>It had become evident that Cervantes could not gain his
bread by literature, and in 1587 he went to Seville to seek
employment in connexion with the provisioning of the Invincible
Armada. He was placed under the orders of Antonio de Guevara,
and before the 24th of February was excommunicated for
excessive zeal in collecting wheat at Écija. During the next
few months he was engaged in gathering stores at Seville and
the adjacent district, and after the defeat of the Armada he was
retained as commissary to the galleys. Tired of the drudgery,
and without any prospect of advancement, on the 21st of May
1590 Cervantes drew up a petition to the king, recording his
services and applying for one of four posts then vacant in the
American colonies: a place in the department of public accounts
in New Granada, the governorship of Soconusco in Guatemala,
the position of auditor to the galleys at Cartagena, or that of
<i>corregidor</i> in the city of La Paz. The petition was referred to
the Council of the Indies, and was annotated with the words:&mdash;&ldquo;Let
him look for something nearer home.&rdquo; Cervantes perforce
remained at his post; the work was hard, uncongenial and
ill-paid, and the salary was in constant arrears. In November
1590 he was in such straits that he borrowed money to buy himself
a suit of clothes, and in August 1592 his sureties were called
upon to make good a deficiency of 795 <i>reales</i> in his accounts.
His thoughts turned to literature once more, and on the 5th of
September 1592, he signed a contract with Rodrigo Osorio
undertaking to write six plays at fifty ducats each, no payment
to be made unless Osorio considered that each of these pieces
was &ldquo;one of the best ever produced in Spain.&rdquo; Nothing came
of this agreement, and it appears that, between the date of
signing it and the 19th of September, Cervantes was imprisoned
(for reasons unknown to us) at Castro del Río. He was speedily
released, and continued to perquisition as before in Andalusia;
but his literary ambitions were not dead, and in May 1595 he
won the first prize&mdash;three silver spoons&mdash;at a poetical tourney
held in honour of St Hyacinth at Saragossa. Shortly afterwards
Cervantes found himself in difficulties with the exchequer
officials. He entrusted a sum of 7400 <i>reales</i> to a merchant
named Simón Freire de Lima with instructions to pay the
amount into the treasury at Madrid; the agent became bankrupt
and absconded, leaving Cervantes responsible for the deficit.
By some means the money was raised, and the debt was liquidated
on the 21st of January 1597. But Cervantes&rsquo; position was
shaken, and his unbusinesslike habits lent themselves to
misinterpretation. On the 6th of September 1597 he was ordered
to find sureties that he would present himself at Madrid within
twenty days, and there submit to the exchequer vouchers for
all official moneys collected by him in Granada and elsewhere.
No such sureties being available, he was committed to Seville
jail, but was released on the 1st of December on condition that
he complied with the original order of the court within thirty
days. He was apparently unable to find bail, was dismissed
from the public service, and sank into extreme poverty. During
a momentary absence from Seville in February 1590, he was
again summoned to Madrid by the treasury, but does not appear
to have obeyed: it is only too likely that he had not the money
to pay for the journey. There is some reason to think that he
was imprisoned at Seville in 1602, but nothing positive is known
of his existence between 1600 and the 8th of February 1603:
at the latter date he seems to have been at Valladolid, to which
city Philip III. had removed the court in 1601.</p>

<p>Since the publication of the <i>Galatea</i> in 1585 Cervantes&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page765" id="page765"></a>765</span>
contributions to literature had been limited to occasional poems.
In 1591 he published a ballad in Andrés de Villalta&rsquo;s <i>Flor de
varios y nuevos romances</i>; in 1595 he composed a poem, already
mentioned, to celebrate the canonization of St Hyacinth; in
1596 he wrote a sonnet ridiculing Medina Sidonia&rsquo;s tardy entry
into Cadiz after the English invaders had retired, and in the
same year his sonnet lauding Santa Cruz was printed in Cristóbal.
Mosquera de Figueroa&rsquo;s <i>Comentario en breve compendio de
disciplina militar</i>; to 1597 is assigned a sonnet (the authenticity
of which is disputed) commemorative of the poet Herrera; in
1598 he wrote two sonnets and a copy of <i>quintillas</i> on the death
of Philip II.; and in 1602 a complimentary sonnet from his pen
appeared in the second edition of Lope de Vega&rsquo;s <i>Dragontea</i>.
Curiously enough, it is by Lope de Vega that <i>Don Quixote</i> is
first mentioned. Writing to an unknown correspondent (apparently
a physician) on the 14th of August 1604, Lope de Vega
says that &ldquo;no poet is as bad as Cervantes, nor so foolish as to
praise <i>Don Quixote</i>,&rdquo; and he goes on to speak of his own plays
as being odious to Cervantes. It is obvious that the two men
had quarrelled since 1602, and that Lope de Vega smarted under
the satire of himself and his works in Cervantes&rsquo; forthcoming
book; <i>Don Quixote</i> may have been circulated in manuscript,
or may even have been printed before the official licence was
granted on the 26th of September 1604. It was published early
in 1605, and was dedicated to the seventh duke de Béjar in
phrases largely borrowed from the dedication in Herrera&rsquo;s
edition (1580) of Garcilaso de la Vega, and from Francisco de
Medina&rsquo;s preface to that work.</p>

<p>The mention of Bernardo de la Vega&rsquo;s <i>Pastor de Iberia</i> shows
that the sixth chapter of <i>Don Quixote</i> cannot have been written
before 1591. In the prologue Cervantes describes his masterpiece
as being &ldquo;just what might be begotten in a jail&rdquo;; on the
strength of this passage, it has been thought that he conceived
the story, and perhaps began writing it, during one of his terms
of imprisonment at Seville between 1597 and 1602. Within a
few weeks of its publication at Madrid, three pirated editions
of <i>Don Quixote</i> were issued at Lisbon; a second authorized
edition, imperfectly revised, was hurried out at Madrid; and
another reprint appeared at Valencia with an <i>aprobación</i> dated
18th July 1605. With the exception of Alemán&rsquo;s <i>Guzmán de
Alfarache</i>, no Spanish book of the period was more successful.
Modern criticism is prone to regard <i>Don Quixote</i> as a symbolic,
didactic or controversial work intended to bring about radical
reforms in church and state. Such interpretations did not occur
to Cervantes&rsquo; contemporaries, nor to Cervantes himself. There
is no reason for rejecting his plain statement that his main object
was to ridicule the romances of chivalry, which in their latest
developments had become a tissue of tiresome absurdities. It
seems clear that his first intention was merely to parody these
extravagances in a short story; but as he proceeded the
immense possibilities of the subject became more evident to
him, and he ended by expanding his work into a brilliant
panorama of Spanish society as it existed during the 16th century.
Nobles, knights, poets, courtly gentlemen, priests, traders,
farmers, barbers, muleteers, scullions and convicts; accomplished
ladies, impassioned damsels, Moorish beauties, simple-hearted
country-girls and kindly kitchen-wenches of questionable morals&mdash;all
these are presented with the genial fidelity which comes of
sympathetic insight. The immediate vogue of <i>Don Quixote</i> was
due chiefly to its variety of incident, to its wealth of comedy
bordering on farce, and perhaps also to its keen thrusts at eminent
contemporaries; its reticent pathos, its large humanity, and
its penetrating criticism of life were less speedily appreciated.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on the 12th of April 1605, Cervantes authorized
his publisher to proceed against the Lisbon booksellers who
threatened to introduce their piratical reprints into Castile. By
June the citizens of Valladolid already regarded Don Quixote
and Sancho Panza as proverbial types. Less gratifying experiences
awaited the popular author. On the 27th of June
1605 Gaspar de Ezpeleta, a Navarrese gentleman of dissolute
life, was wounded outside the lodging-house in which Cervantes
and his family lived; he was taken indoors, was nursed by
Cervantes&rsquo; sister Magdalena, and died on the 29th of June. That
same day Cervantes, his natural daughter (Isabel de Saavedra),
his sister Andrea and her daughter were lodged in jail on suspicion
of being indirectly concerned in Ezpeleta&rsquo;s death; one of the
witnesses made damaging charges against Cervantes&rsquo; daughter,
but no substantial evidence was produced, and the prisoners
were released. Little is known of Cervantes&rsquo; life between 1605
and 1608. A <i>Relación</i> of the festivities held to celebrate the
birth of Philip IV., and a certain <i>Carta á don Diego Astudillo
Carrillo</i> have been erroneously ascribed to him; during these
three years he apparently wrote nothing beyond three sonnets,
and one of these is of doubtful authenticity. The depositions
of the Valladolid enquiry show that he was living in poverty five
months after the appearance of <i>Don Quixote</i>, and the fact that
he borrowed 450 <i>reales</i> from his publisher before November 1607
would convey the idea that his position improved slowly, if at
all. But it is difficult to reconcile this view of his circumstances
with the details concerning his illegitimate daughter revealed
in documents recently discovered. Isabel de Saavedra was
stated to be a spinster when arrested at Valladolid in June 1605;
the settlement of her marriage with Luis de Molina in 1608
describes her as the widow of Diego Sanz, as the mother of a
daughter eight months old, and as owning house-property of
some value. These particulars are perplexing, and the situation
is further complicated by the publication of a deed in which
Cervantes declares that he himself is the real owner of this house-property,
and that his daughter has merely a life-interest in it.
This claim may be regarded as a legal fiction; it cannot easily
be reconciled with Cervantes&rsquo; statement towards the end of his
life, that he was dependent on the bounty of the count de Lemos
and of Bernardo de Sandoval, cardinal-archbishop of Toledo.
In 1609 he joined the newly founded confraternity of the Slaves
of the Most Blessed Sacrament; in 1610 Lemos was appointed
viceroy of Naples, and Cervantes was keenly disappointed at
not being chosen to accompany his patron. In 1611 he lost his
sister Magdalena, who was buried by the charity of the Tertiaries
of Saint Francis; in 1612 he joined the Academia Selvaje, and
there appears to have renewed his former friendly relations with
Lope de Vega; in 1613 he dedicated his <i>Novelas exemplares</i> to
the count de Lemos, and disposed of his rights for 1600 <i>reales</i>
and twenty-four copies of the book. The twelve tales in this
volume, some of them written very much later than others, are
of unequal merit, but they contain some of the writer&rsquo;s best work,
and the two picaresque stories&mdash;<i>Rinconete y Cortadillo</i> and the
<i>Coloquio de los perros</i>&mdash;are superb examples of their kind, and
would alone entitle Cervantes to take rank with the greatest
masters of Spanish prose. In 1614 he published the <i>Viage del
Parnaso</i>, a burlesque poem suggested by the <i>Viaggio in Parnaso</i>
(1582) of the Perugian poet Cesare Caporali. It contains some
interesting autobiographical passages, much flattery of contemporary
poetasters, and a few happy satirical touches; but,
though it is Cervantes&rsquo; most serious bid for fame as a poet, it has
seldom been reprinted, and would probably have been forgotten
but for an admirably humorous postscript in prose which is
worthy of the author at his best. In the preface to his <i>Ocho
comedias y ocho entremeses nuevos</i> (1615) he good-humouredly
admits that his dramatic works found no favour with managers,
and, when this collection was first reprinted (1749), the editor
advanced the fantastic theory that the <i>comedias</i> were deliberate
exercises in absurdity, intended to parody the popular dramas
of the day. This view cannot be maintained, but a sharp distinction
must be drawn between the eight set plays and the eight
interludes; with one or two exceptions, the <i>comedias</i> or set plays
are unsuccessful experiments in Lope de Vega&rsquo;s manner, while
the <i>entremeses</i> or <i>interludes</i>, particularly those in prose, are models
of spontaneous gaiety and ingenious wit.</p>

<p>In the preface to the <i>Novelas exemplares</i> Cervantes had
announced the speedy appearance of the sequel to <i>Don Quixote</i>
which he had vaguely promised at the end of the first part. He
was at work on the fifty-ninth chapter of his continuation when
he learned that he had been anticipated by Alonso Fernandez
de Avellaneda of Tordesillas, whose <i>Segunde tamo del ingenioso
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page766" id="page766"></a>766</span>
hidalgo don Quixote de la Mancha</i> was published at Tarragona
in 1614. On the assumption that Fernandez de Avellaneda
is a pseudonym, this spurious sequel has been ascribed to the
king&rsquo;s confessor, Luis de Aliaga, to Cervantes&rsquo; old enemy,
Blanco de Paz, to his old friend, Bartolomé Leonardo de
Argensola, to the three great dramatists, Lope de Vega, Tirso de
Molina and Ruiz de Alarcón, to Alonso Fernandez, to Juan José
Martí, to Alfonso Lamberto, to Luis de Granada, and probably
to others. Some of these attributions are manifestly absurd&mdash;for
example, Luis de Granada died seventeen years before the
first part of <i>Don Quixote</i> was published&mdash;and all of them are
improbable conjectures; if Avellaneda be not the real name
of the author, his identity is still undiscovered. His book is
not devoid of literary talent and robust humour, and possibly
he began it under the impression that Cervantes was no more
likely to finish <i>Don Quixote</i> than to finish the <i>Galatea</i>.
He should, however, have abandoned his project on reading the
announcement in the preface to the <i>Novelas exemplares</i>; what
he actually did was to disgrace himself by writing an insolent
preface taunting Cervantes with his physical defects, his moral
infirmities, his age, loneliness and experiences in jail. He was
too intelligent to imagine that his continuation could hold its
own against the authentic sequel, and malignantly avowed his
intention of being first in the field and so spoiling Cervantes&rsquo;
market. It is quite possible that <i>Don Quixote</i> might have been
left incomplete but for this insulting intrusion; Cervantes was
a leisurely writer and was, as he states, engaged on <i>El Engaño
à los ojos, Las Semanas del Jardín</i> and <i>El Famoso Bernardo</i>,
none of which have been preserved. Avellaneda forced him to
concentrate his attention on his masterpiece, and the authentic
second part of <i>Don Quixote</i> appeared towards the end of 1615.
No book more signally contradicts the maxim, quoted by the
Bachelor Carrasco, that &ldquo;no second part was ever good.&rdquo; It
is true that the last fourteen chapters are damaged by undignified
denunciations of Avellaneda; but, apart from this, the second
part of <i>Don Quixote</i> is an improvement on the first. The humour
is more subtle and mature; the style is of more even excellence;
and the characters of the bachelor and of the physician, Pedro
Recio de Agüero, are presented with a more vivid effect than
any of the secondary characters in the first part. Cervantes had
clearly profited by the criticism of those who objected to &ldquo;the
countless cudgellings inflicted on Señor Don Quixote,&rdquo; and to
the irrelevant interpolation of extraneous stories in the text.
Don Quixote moves through the second part with unruffled
dignity; Sancho Panza loses something of his rustic cunning,
but he gains in wit, sense and manners. The original conception
is unchanged in essentials, but it is more logically developed,
and there is a notable progress in construction. Cervantes
had grown to love his knight and squire, and he understood his
own creations better than at the outset; more completely
master of his craft, he wrote his sequel with the unfaltering
confidence of a renowned artist bent on sustaining his reputation.</p>

<p>The first part of <i>Don Quixote</i> had been reprinted at Madrid in
1608; it had been produced at Brussels in 1607 and 1611, and
at Milan in 1610; it had been translated into English in 1612
and into French in 1614. Cervantes was celebrated in and out
of Spain, but his celebrity had not brought him wealth. The
members of the French special embassy, sent to Madrid in
February 1615, under the Commandeur de Sillery, heard with amazement
that the author of the <i>Galatea</i>, the <i>Novelas exemplares</i>
and <i>Don Quixote</i> was &ldquo;old, a soldier, a gentleman and poor.&rdquo;
But his trials were almost at an end. Though failing in health,
he worked assiduously at <i>Los Trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda</i>,
which, as he had jocosely prophesied in the preface to the second
part of <i>Don Quixote</i>, would be &ldquo;either the worst or the best
book ever written in our tongue.&rdquo; It is the most carefully
written of his prose works, and the least animated or attractive
of them; signs of fatigue and of waning powers are unmistakably
visible. Cervantes was not destined to see it in print. He was
attacked by dropsy, and, on the 18th of April 1616, received the
sacrament of extreme unction; next day he wrote the dedication
of <i>Persiles y Sigismunda</i> to the count de Lemos&mdash;the most
moving and gallant of farewells. He died at Madrid in the Calle
del León on the 23rd of April; he was borne from his house
&ldquo;with his face uncovered,&rdquo; according to the rule of the Tertiaries
of St Francis, and on the 24th of April was buried in the church
attached to the convent of the Trinitarian nuns in the Calle de
Cantarranas. There he rests&mdash;the story of his remains being
removed in 1633 to the Calle del Humilladero has no foundation
in fact&mdash;but the exact position of his grave is unknown. Early
in 1617 <i>Persiles y Sigismunda</i> was published, and passed through
eight editions within two years; but the interest in it soon died
away, and it was not reprinted between 1625 and 1719.
Cervantes&rsquo; wife died without issue on the 31st of October 1626;
his natural daughter, who survived both the child of her first
marriage and her second husband, died on the 20th of September
1652. Cervantes is represented solely by his works. The
<i>Novelas exemplares</i> alone would give him the foremost place
among Spanish novelists; <i>Don Quixote</i> entitles him to rank
with the greatest writers of all time: &ldquo;children turn its leaves,
young people read it, grown men understand it, old folk praise
it.&rdquo; It has outlived all changes of literary taste, and is even
more popular to-day than it was three centuries ago.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CERVERA, PASCUAL CERVERA Y TOPETE<a name="ar18" id="ar18"></a></span> (1839-1909),
Spanish admiral, was born at Medina Sidonia on the 18th of
February 1839. He showed an early inclination for the sea, and
his family sent him to the naval cadet school at the age of twelve.
As a sub-lieutenant he took part in the naval operations on the
coast of Morocco during the campaign of 1859-60. Then he was
for some time engaged in operations in the Sulu Islands and the
Philippines. Afterwards he was on the West Indian station
during the early part of the first Cuban War (1868-78), returning
to Spain in 1873 to serve on the Basque coast against the Carlists.
He distinguished himself in defending the Carraca arsenal near
Cadiz against the Federals in 1873. He won each step in his
promotion up to flag-rank through his steadiness and brilliant
conduct in action, and was awarded the crosses of the Orders of
Military and Naval Merit, Isabella the Catholic, and St Hermengilde,
besides several medals. Cervera had a great reputation
for decision, unbending temper and honesty, before he was
placed at the head of the Bilbao building-yards. This post he
resigned after a few months in order to become minister of
marine in 1892, in a cabinet presided over by Sagasta. He withdrew
from the cabinet when he found that his colleagues, from
political motives, declined to support him in making reforms and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page767" id="page767"></a>767</span>
on the other hand, unwisely cut down the naval estimates. When
in 1898 the Spanish-American War (<i>q.v.</i>) broke out, he was chosen
to command a squadron composed of four first-class cruisers,
the &ldquo;Maria Theresa,&rdquo; his flagship, &ldquo;Oquendo,&rdquo; &ldquo;Vizcaya,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Columbus,&rdquo; and several destroyers. This ill-fated squadron
only started upon its reckless cruise across the ocean after its
gallant commander had repeatedly warned both the minister of
marine and the prime minister, Sagasta, in despatches from Cadiz
and from the Canary and Cape Verde Islands, that the ships
were insufficiently provided with coal and ammunition. Some
of them, indeed, even lacked proper guns. In compliance with
the instructions of the government, Admiral Cervera made for
the landlocked harbour of Santiago de Cuba, where he co-operated
in the defence, landing some guns and a naval brigade. In spite
of his energetic representations, Cervera received an order from
Madrid, dictated by political considerations, to sally forth. It
meant certain destruction. The gallant squadron met forces
trebly superior to it, and was totally destroyed. The admiral,
three of his captains, and 1800 sailors and marines were taken
by the victors to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, U.S.A. After
the war, Cervera and his captains were tried before the supreme
naval and military court of the realm, which honourably
acquitted them all. In 1901 he became vice-admiral, in 1902
was appointed chief of staff of the Spanish navy, and in 1903
was made life senator. He died at Puerto Real on the 3rd of
April 1909.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CESAREVICH,<a name="ar19" id="ar19"></a></span> or more properly <span class="sc">Tsesarevich</span>, the title of
the heir-apparent to the Russian throne. The full official title
is <i>Nasliednik Tsesarevich</i>, <i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;heir of Caesar,&rdquo; and in Russia
the heir to the throne is commonly called simply <i>Nasliednik</i>, the
word <i>Tsesarevich</i> never being used alone. <i>Tsarevich</i>, a form now
much used in England, means simply any &ldquo;king&rsquo;s son&rdquo;; it is an
antiquated term now out of use in Russia, and was last borne
as heir to the throne by the unfortunate Alexius, son of Peter
the Great. The style of the wife of the tsesarevich is <i>Tsesarevna</i>.
The Cesarewitch handicap race at Newmarket, founded in 1839,
was named after the prince who was afterwards Alexander II.
of Russia, who paid a state visit to England that year.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CESARI, GIUSEPPE,<a name="ar20" id="ar20"></a></span> called Il Cavaliere d&rsquo; Arpino (born in
or about 1568 and created a &ldquo;Cavaliere di Cristo&rdquo; by Pope
Clement VIII.), also named Il Giuseppino, an Italian painter,
much encouraged at Rome and munificently rewarded. His
father had been a native of Arpino, but Giuseppe himself was
born in Rome. Cesari is stigmatized by Lanzi as not less the
corrupter of taste in painting than Marino was in poetry; indeed,
another of the nicknames of Cesari is &ldquo;Il Marino de&rsquo; Pittori&rdquo;
(the pictorial Marino). There was spirit in Cesari&rsquo;s heads of
men and horses, and his frescoes in the Capitol (story of Romulus
and Remus, &amp;c.), which occupied him at intervals during forty
years, are well coloured; but he drew the human form ill. His
perspective is faulty, his extremities monotonous, and his
chiaroscuro defective. He died in 1640, at the age of seventy-two,
or perhaps of eighty, at Rome. Cesari ranks as the head of
the &ldquo;Idealists&rdquo; of his period, as opposed to the &ldquo;Naturalists,&rdquo;
of whom Michelangelo da Caravaggio was the leading champion,&mdash;the
so-called &ldquo;idealism&rdquo; consisting more in reckless facility,
and disregard of the common facts and common-sense of nature,
than in anything to which so lofty a name could be properly
accorded. He was a man of touchy and irascible character, and
rose from penury to the height of opulence. His brother
Bernardino assisted in many of his works.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CESAROTTI, MELCHIORE<a name="ar21" id="ar21"></a></span> (1730-1808), Italian poet, was
born at Padua in 1730, of a noble but impoverished family. At
the university of his native place his literary progress procured
for him at a very early age the chair of rhetoric, and in 1768 the
professorship of Greek and Hebrew. On the invasion of Italy
by the French, he gave his pen to their cause, received a pension,
and was made knight of the iron crown by Napoleon I., to whom,
in consequence, he addressed a bombastic and extravagantly
flattering poem called <i>Pronea</i>. Cesarotti is best known as the
translator of Homer and Ossian. Much praise cannot be given
to his version of the <i>Iliad</i>, for he has not scrupled to add, omit
and modernize. Ossian, which he held to be the finest of poems,
he has, on the other hand, considerably improved in translation;
and the appearance of his version attracted much attention in
Italy and France, and raised up many imitators of the Ossianic
style. Cesarotti also produced a number of works in prose,
including a <i>Course of Greek Literature</i>, and essays <i>On the Origin
and Progress of the Poetic Art</i>, <i>On the Sources of the Pleasure
derived from Tragedy</i>, <i>On the Philosophy of Language</i> and <i>On
the Philosophy of Taste</i>, the last being a defence of his own
great eccentricities in criticism. His weakness was a straining
after novelty. His style is forcible, but full of Gallicisms.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>A complete edition of his works, in 42 vols. 8vo. began to appear at
Pisa in 1800, and was completed in 1813, after his death. See

<p><span class="bold">CESENA<a name="ar22" id="ar22"></a></span> (anc. <i>Caesena</i>), a town and episcopal see of Emilia,
Italy, in the province of Forlì, 12 m. S.E. by rail from the town
of Forlì, on the line between Bologna and Rimini, 144 ft. above
sea-level. Pop. (1905) 12,245 (town); 43,468 (commune). The
town is picturesquely situated at the foot of the slopes of the
Apennines, and is crowned by a medieval fortress (Rocca),
begun by the emperor Frederick I. (Barbarossa) probably, but
altered and added to later. The cathedral has two fine marble
altars by the Lombardi of Venice (or their school). The library,
built for Domenico Malatesta in 1452 by Matteo Nuzio, is a fine
early Renaissance building, and its internal arrangements, with
the original desks to which the books are still chained, are
especially well preserved (see J.W. Clark, <i>The Care of Books</i>,
Cambridge, 1901, p. 199). In it are valuable MSS., many of which
were used by Aldus Manutius. It also contains a picture gallery
with a good &ldquo;Presentation in the Temple&rdquo; by Francesco
Francia. There are some fine palaces in the town. Three-quarters
of a mile south-east on the hill stands the handsome
church of S. Maria del Monte, after the style of Bramante, with
carved stalls of the 16th century. Wine, hemp and silk are the
main articles of trade. About the ancient Caesena little is said
in classical authors: it is mentioned as a station on the Via
Aemilia and as a fortress in the wars of Theodoric and Narses.
During the middle ages it was at first independent. In 1357
it was unsuccessfully defended by the wife of Francesco Ordelaffi,
lord of Forlì, against the papal troops under Albornoz. In 1377
it was sacked by Cardinal Robert of Geneva (afterwards Clement
VII., antipope). It was then held by the Malatesta of Rimini
until 1465, when it came under the dominion of the church.
Both Pius VI. (1717) and Pius VII. (1742) were born at
Cesena.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CESNOLA, LUIGI PALMA DI<a name="ar23" id="ar23"></a></span> (1832-1904), Italian-American
soldier and archaeologist, was born near Turin on the 29th of
July 1832. Having served in the Austrian and Crimean Wars,
in 1860 he went to New York, where he taught Italian and
French and founded a military school for officers. He took
part in the American Civil War as colonel of a cavalry regiment,
and at Aldie (June 1863) was wounded and taken prisoner.
He was released from Libby prison early in 1864, served in the
Wilderness and Petersburg campaigns (1864-65) as a brigadier
of cavalry, and at the close of the war was breveted brigadier-general.
He was then appointed United States consul at
Larnaca in Cyprus (1865-1877). During his stay in the island
he carried on excavations, which resulted in the discovery of a
large number of antiquities. The collection was purchased by
the Metropolitan Museum of New York, and Cesnola became
director in 1879. Doubt having been thrown by Gaston L.
Feuerdant, in an article in the New York <i>Herald</i> (August 1880),
upon the genuineness of his restorations, the matter was referred
to a special committee, which pronounced in his favour.<a name="fa1b" id="fa1b" href="#ft1b"><span class="sp">1</span></a> He is
the author of <i>Cyprus, its ancient Cities, Tombs and Temples</i>
(1877), an interesting book of travel and of considerable service
to the practical antiquary; and of a <i>Descriptive Atlas of the
Cesnola Collection of Cypriote Antiquities</i> (3 vols., 1884-6). He
died in New York on the 21st of November 1904. He was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page768" id="page768"></a>768</span>
member of several learned societies in Europe and America, and
in 1897 he received a Congressional medal of honour for conspicuous
military services.</p>

<p>His brother, <span class="sc">Alessandro Palma di Cesnola</span>, born in 1839,
conducted excavations at Paphos (where he was U.S. vice-consul)
and Salamis on behalf of the British government. The results
of these are described in <i>Salaminia</i> (1882).</p>

<p><span class="bold">CESPEDES<a name="ar24" id="ar24"></a></span> (in Ital. <span class="sc">Cedaspe</span>), <span class="bold">PABLO DE</span> (1538-1608),
Spanish poet, painter, sculptor and architect, was born at
Cordova, and was educated at Alcalá de Henares, where he
studied theology and Oriental languages. On leaving the
university, he went to Rome, where he became the pupil and
friend of Federigo Zuccaro, under whose direction he studied
particularly the works of Raphael and of Michelangelo. In 1560,
while yet in Rome, proceedings were taken against him by the
Inquisition at Valladolid on account of a letter which, found
among the papers of the archbishop of Toledo, had been written
by Cespedes during the preceding year, and in which he had
spoken with great freedom against the holy office and the inquisitor-general,
Fernando de Valdés. Cespedes remained in
Rome at this critical moment, and he appears rightly to have
treated the prosecution with derision. It is not known how he
contrived to bring the proceedings to an end; he returned,
however, to Spain a little before 1577, and in that year was
installed in a prebend of the cathedral at Cordova, where he
resided till his death. Pablo de Cespedes has been called the
most <i>savant</i> of Spanish artists. According to his friend Francisco
Pacheco, to whom posterity is indebted for the preservation of
all of Cespedes&rsquo;s verse that is extant, the school of Seville owes
to him its introduction to the practice of chiaroscuro. He was
a bold and correct draughtsman, a skilful anatomist, a master
of colour and composition; and the influence he exerted to the
advantage of early Spanish art was considerable. Cristobal de
Vera, Juan de Peñalosa and Zambrano were among his pupils.
His best picture is a Last Supper at Cordova, but there are good
examples of his work at Seville and at Madrid. Cespedes was
author of several opuscules in prose on subjects connected with
his profession. Of his poem on <i>The Art of Painting</i> enough was
preserved by Pacheco to enable us to form an opinion of the
whole. It is esteemed the best didactic verse in Spanish; and
it has been compared, not disadvantageously, with the <i>Georgics</i>.
It is written in strong and sonorous octaves, in the majestic
declamatory vein of Fernando Herrera, and is not altogether
so dull and lifeless as is most didactic verse. It contains a glowing
eulogy of Michelangelo, and some excellent advice to young
painters, insisting particularly on hard work and on the study
of nature. The few fragments yet remaining, amounting in all
to some six hundred lines, were first printed by Pacheco in his
treatise <i>Del arte de la pintura</i>, in 1649.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CÉSPEDES Y MENESES, GONZALO DE<a name="ar25" id="ar25"></a></span> (1585?-1638),
Spanish novelist, was born at Madrid about 1585. Nothing
positive is known of him before the publication of his celebrated
romance, the <i>Poema trágico del Español Gerardo, y desengaño
del amor lascivo</i> (1615-1617); there is evidence that he had
been sentenced to eight years at the galleys previous to the 1st
of January 1620, and that the penalty had been remitted; but
the nature of his offence is not stated. His treatment of political
questions in the <i>Historia apologética en los sucesos del reyno de
Aragón, y su ciudad de Zaragoza, años de 91 y 92</i> (1622), having
led to the confiscation of the book, Céspedes took up his residence
at Saragossa and Lisbon. While in exile he issued a collection
of short stories entitled <i>Historias peregrinas y exemplares</i> (1623),
the unfinished romance <i>Varia fortuna del soldado Píndaro</i> (1626),
and the first part of his <i>Historia de Felipe IV.</i> (1631), a fulsome
eulogy which was rewarded by the author&rsquo;s appointment as
official historiographer to the Spanish king. Céspedes died on
the 27th of January 1638. His novels, though written in a
ponderous, affected style, display considerable imagination and
insight into character. The <i>Poema trágico</i> has been utilized by
Fletcher in <i>The Spanish Curate</i> and in <i>The Maid of the Mill</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CESSIO BONORUM<a name="ar27" id="ar27"></a></span> (Latin for a &ldquo;surrender of goods&rdquo;), in
Roman law, a voluntary surrender of goods by a debtor to his
creditors. It did not amount to a discharge unless the property
ceded was sufficient for the purpose, but it secured the debtor
from personal arrest. The creditors sold the goods in satisfaction,
<i>pro tanto</i>, of their claims. The procedure of <i>cessio bonorum</i>
avoided infamy, and the debtor, though his after-acquired
property might be proceeded against, could not be deprived of
the bare necessaries of life. The main features of the Roman
law of <i>cessio bonorum</i> were adopted in Scots law, and also in the

<p><span class="bold">CESTI, MARC&rsquo; ANTONIO<a name="ar28" id="ar28"></a></span> (1620?-1669?), Italian musical
composer, was born at Florence about 1620. He was a pupil
of Carissimi, and after holding a post somewhere in Florence as
<i>maestro di cappella</i> entered the papal chapel in 1660. In 1666 he
became <i>Vice-Kapellmeister</i> at Vienna, and died at Venice in 1669.
Cesti is known principally as a composer of operas, the most
celebrated of which were <i>La Dori</i> (Venice, 1663) and <i>Il Pomo

<p><span class="bold">CESTIUS, LUCIUS,<a name="ar29" id="ar29"></a></span> surnamed Pius, Latin rhetorician,

Smyrna, a Greek by birth. According to Jerome, he was
teaching Latin at Rome in the year 13 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> He must have been
living after <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 9, since we are told that he taunted the son of
Quintilius Varus with his father&rsquo;s defeat in the Teutoburgian
forest (Seneca, <i>Controv.</i> i. 3, 10). Cestius was a man of
great ability, but vain, quarrelsome and sarcastic. Before he
left Asia, he was invited to dinner by Cicero&rsquo;s son, then governor
of the province. His host, being uncertain as to his identity,
asked a slave who Cestius was; and on receiving the answer,
&ldquo;he is the man who said your father was illiterate,&rdquo; ordered
him to be flogged (Seneca, <i>Suasoriae</i>, vii. 13). As an orator
in the schools Cestius enjoyed a great reputation, and was
worshipped by his youthful pupils, one of whom imitated him
so slavishly that he was nicknamed &ldquo;my monkey&rdquo; by his
teacher (Seneca, <i>Controv.</i> ix. 3, 12). As a public orator, on the
other hand, he was a failure. Although a Greek, he always
used Latin in his declamations, and, although he was sometimes
at a loss for Latin words, he never suffered from lack of ideas.
Numerous specimens of his declamations will be found in the
works of Seneca the rhetorician.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CETACEA<a name="ar31" id="ar31"></a></span> (from the Gr. <span class="grk" title="ketos">&#954;&#941;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span>, a whale), the name of the
mammalian order represented by whales, dolphins, porpoises, &amp;c.
From their fish-like form, which is manifestly merely an adaptation
to their purely aquatic life, these creatures are often regarded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page769" id="page769"></a>769</span>
as fishes, although they are true mammals, with warm blood,
and suckle their young.</p>

<p>The general form is essentially fish-like, the spindle-shaped
body passing anteriorly into the head without any distinct neck,
and posteriorly tapering gradually towards the extremity of the
tail, which is provided with a pair of lateral, pointed expansions
of skin supported by fibrous tissue, called &ldquo;flukes,&rdquo; forming
a horizontal triangular propelling organ, notched behind in the
middle line. The head is generally large, in some cases attaining
more than one-third the entire length; and the mouth is wide,
and bounded by stiff, immobile lips. The fore-limbs are reduced
to flattened paddles, encased in a continuous skin, showing no
external sign of division, and without trace of nails. There are
no signs of hind-limbs visible externally. The surface of the
skin is smooth and glistening, and devoid of hair, although in
many species there are a few bristles in the neighbourhood of
the mouth which may persist through life or be present only
in the young state. Immediately beneath the skin is a thick
layer of fat, held together by a mesh of tissue, constituting
the &ldquo;blubber,&rdquo; which retains the heat of the body. In nearly
all species a compressed dorsal fin is present. The eye is
small, and not provided with a true lacrymal apparatus. The
external ear is a minute aperture in the skin situated at a
short distance behind the eye. The nostrils open separately or
by a single crescentic aperture, near the vertex of the head.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The bones generally are spongy in texture, the cavities being
filled with oil. In the vertebral column, the cervical region is short
and immobile, and the vertebrae, always seven in number, are in
many species more or less fused together into a solid mass. The
odontoid process of the second cervical vertebra, when that bone
is free, is usually very obtuse, or even obsolete. In a paper on
the form and function of the cervical vertebrae published in the
<i>Jenaische Zeitschrift</i> for 1905, Dr O. Reche points out that the
shortening and soldering is most pronounced in species which, like
the right-whales, live entirely on minute organisms, to capture
which there is no necessity to turn the head at all. Accordingly
we find that in these whales the whole seven cervical vertebrae are
fused into an immovable solid mass, of which the compound
elements, with the exception of the first and second, are but little
thicker than plates. On the other hand, in the finner-whales,
several of which live exclusively on fish, and thus require a certain
amount of mobility in the head and neck, we find all the cervical
vertebrae much thicker and entirely separate from one another.
Among the dolphin group the narwhal and the white whale, or
beluga, are distinguished from all other cetaceans by the great comparative
length of their cervical vertebrae, all of which are completely
free. In the case of the narwhal such an abnormal structure
is easily accounted for, seeing that to use effectively the long tusk
with which the male is armed a considerable amount of mobility in
the neck is absolutely essential. The beluga, too, which is believed
to feed on large and active fishes, would likewise seem to require
mobility in the same region in order to effect their capture. On
the other hand, the porpoise preys on herrings, pilchards and
mackerel, which in their densely packed shoals must apparently
fall an easy prey with but little exertion on the part of their
captor, and we accordingly find all the neck-vertebrae very short,
and at least six out of the seven coalesced into a solid immovable
mass. None of the vertebrae are united to form a sacrum.
The lumbar and caudal vertebrae are numerous and large, and,
as their arches are not connected by articular processes (zygapophyses),
they are capable of free motion in all directions. The caps,
or epiphyses, at the end of the vertebral bodies are flattened
disks, not uniting until after the animal has attained its full dimensions.
There are largely developed chevron-bones on the under side
of the tail, the presence of which indicates the distinction between
caudal and lumbar vertebrae.</p>

<p>In the skull, the brain-case is short, broad and high, almost
spherical, in fact (fig. 1). The supra-occipital bone rises upwards
and forwards from the foramen magnum, to meet the frontals at the
vertex, completely excluding the parietals from the upper region;
and the frontals are expanded laterally to form the roof of the orbits.
The nasal aperture opens upwards, and has in front of it a more or
less horizontally prolonged beak, formed of the maxillae, premaxillae,
vomer, and mesethmoid cartilage, extending forwards to form the
upper jaw or roof of the mouth.</p>

<p>There are no clavicles. The humerus is freely movable on the
scapula at the shoulder-joint, but beyond this the articulations of
the limb are imperfect; the flattened ends of the bones coming in
contact, with fibrous tissue interposed, allowing of scarcely any
motion. The radius and ulna are distinct, and about equally developed,
and much flattened, as are all the bones of the flippers.
There are four, or more commonly five, digits, and the number of
the phalanges of the second and third always exceeds the normal
number in mammals, sometimes considerably; they present the
exceptional character of having epiphyses at both ends. The pelvis
is represented by a pair of small rod-like bones placed longitudinally,
suspended below and at some distance from the vertebral column
at the commencement of the tail. In some species, to the outer
surface of these are fixed other small bones or cartilages, the rudiments
of the hind-limb.</p>

<p>Teeth are generally present, but exceedingly variable in number.
In existing species, they are of simple, uniform character, with
conical or compressed crowns and single roots, and are never preceded
by milk-teeth. In the whalebone whales teeth are absent
(except in the foetal condition), and the palate is provided with
numerous transversely placed horny plates, forming the &ldquo;whalebone.&rdquo;
Salivary glands are rudimentary or absent. The stomach
is complex, and the intestine simple, and only in some species
provided with a small caecum. The liver is little fissured, and
there is no gall-bladder. The blood-vascular system is complicated
by net-like expansions of both arteries and veins, or <i>retia mirabilia</i>,
The larynx is of peculiar shape, the arytenoid cartilages and the
epiglottis being elongated, and forming a tubular prolongation,
which projects into the posterior nares, and when embraced by the
soft palate forms a continuous passage between the nostrils and the
trachea, or wind-pipe, in a more perfect manner. The brain is
relatively large, round in form, with its surface divided into numerous
and complex convolutions. The kidneys are deeply lobulated; the
testes are abdominal; and there are no vesiculae seminales nor an
os penis. The uterus is bicornuate; the placenta non-deciduate and
diffuse. The two teats are placed in depressions on each side of the
genital aperture. The ducts of the milk-glands are dilated during
suckling into large reservoirs, into which the milk collects, and from
which it is injected by the action of a muscle into the mouth of the
young animal, so that sucking under water is greatly facilitated.</p>
</div>

<p>Whales and porpoises are found in all seas, and some dolphins
and porpoises are inhabitants of the larger rivers of South America
and Asia. Their organization necessitates their passing their
life entirely in the water, as on land they are absolutely helpless.
They have, however, to rise very frequently to the surface for
the purpose of respiration; and, in relation to the upward and
downward movement in the water thus necessitated, the principal
instrument of motion, the tail, is expanded horizontally. The
position of the nostril on the highest part of the head is important
for this mode of life, as it is the only part of the body the exposure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page770" id="page770"></a>770</span>
of which above the surface is absolutely necessary. Of numerous
erroneous ideas connected with natural history, few are so
widespread as that whales spout through their blow-holes water
taken in at the mouth. But the &ldquo;spouting,&rdquo; or &ldquo;blowing,&rdquo; of
whales is nothing more than the ordinary act of expiration,
which, taking place at longer intervals than land-animals, is
performed with a greater emphasis. The moment the animal
rises to the surface it forcibly expels from its lungs the air taken
in at the last inspiration, which is charged with vapour in consequence
of the respiratory changes. This rapidly condensing in
the cold atmosphere in which the phenomenon is often observed,
forms a column of steam or spray, which has been taken for
water. It happens, however, especially when the surface of the
ocean is agitated into waves, that the animal commences its
expiratory puff before the orifice has cleared the top of the water,
some of which may thus be driven upwards with the blast, tending
to complete the illusion. From photographs of spouting rorquals,
it appears that the height and volume of the &ldquo;spout&rdquo; of all the
species is much less than was supposed to be the case by the older
observers; even that of the huge &ldquo;sulphur-bottom&rdquo; (<i>Balaenoptera
sibbaldi</i>) averaging only about 14 ft. in height, although it
may occasionally reach 20 ft.</p>

<p>As regards their powers of hearing, the capacity of cetaceans
for receiving (and acting upon) sound-waves is demonstrated by
the practice of shouting on the part of the fishermen when engaged
in driving a shoal of porpoises or black-fish into shallow water, for
the purpose of frightening their intended victims. As regards the
possession of a voice by cetaceans, it is stated that one species,
the &ldquo;buckelwal&rdquo; of the Germans, utters during the breeding-season
a prolonged scream, comparable to the scream of a steam-siren,
and embracing the whole musical scale, from base to treble.
In respect of anatomical considerations, it is true that the external
ear is much reduced, the &ldquo;pinna&rdquo; being absent, and the tube
or &ldquo;meatus&rdquo; of very small calibre. On the other hand, the
internal auditory organs are developed on the plan of those of
ordinary mammals, but display certain peculiar modifications
(notably the remarkable shell-like form of the tympanic bone)
for intensifying and strengthening the sound-waves as they are
received from the water. It seems, therefore, perfectly evident
that whales must hear when in the water. This inference is
confirmed by the comparatively small development of the other
sense-organs. The eye, for instance, is very small, and can be
of little use even at the comparatively small depths to which
whales are now believed to descend. Again, the sense of smell,
judging from the rudimentary condition of the olfactory organs,
must be in abeyance; and whales have no sense-organs comparable
to the lateral-line-system of fishes. Consequently,
it would seem that when below the surface of the water they must
depend chiefly upon the sense of hearing. Probably this sense
is so highly developed as to enable the animals, in the midst of
the vibrations made by the screw-like movements of the tail, or
flukes, to distinguish the sound (or the vibrations) made by the
impact of water against rocks, even in a dead calm, and, in the
case of piscivorous species, to recognize by the pulse in the water
the presence of a shoal of fish. Failing this explanation, it is
difficult to imagine how whales can find their way about in the
semi-darkness, and avoid collisions with rocks and rock-bound
coasts.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In the Christiania <i>Nyt Magazin for Naturvidenskaberne</i>, vol.
xxxviii., Dr G. Guldberg has published some observations on the
body-temperature of the Cetacea, in which he shows how extremely
imperfect is our knowledge of this subject. As he remarks, it is a
matter of extreme difficulty to obtain the temperature of living
cetaceans, although this has been taken in the case of a white-whale
and a dolphin, which some years ago were kept in confinement in a
pond in the United States. With the larger whales such a mode of
procedure is, however, obviously quite impracticable, and we have,
accordingly, to rely on <i>post-mortem</i> observations. The layer of
blubber by which all cetaceans are protected from cold renders the
<i>post-mortem</i> refrigeration of the blood a much slower process than
in most mammals, so that such observations have a much higher
value than might at first be supposed to be the case. Indeed, the
blood-temperature of a specimen of Sibbald&rsquo;s rorqual three days
after death still stood at 34° C. The various observations that
have been taken have afforded the following results in individual
cases: Sperm-whale, 40° C.; Greenland right-whale, 38.8° C.;
porpoise, 35.6° C.; liver of a second individual, 37.8° C.; common
rorqual, 35.4° C.; dolphin, 35.6° C. The average blood-temperature
of man is 37° C., and that of other mammals 39° C.; while that of
birds is 42 C. The record of 40° C. in the case of the sperm-whale
seems to indicate that at least some cetaceans have a relatively
high temperature.</p>
</div>

<p>With the possible exception of one West African dolphin, all
the Cetacea are predaceous, subsisting on living animal food of
some kind. One kind alone (<i>Orca</i>) eats other warm-blooded
animals, as seals, and even members of its own order, both large
and small. Many feed on fish, others on small floating crustaceans,
pteropods and jelly-fishes, while the principal staple of
the food of many is constituted by cuttle-fishes and squids. In
size cetaceans vary much, some of the smaller dolphins scarcely
exceeding 4 ft. in length, while whales are the most colossal of
all animals. It is true that many statements of their bulk are
exaggerated, but the actual dimensions of the larger species
exceed those of all other animals, not even excluding the extinct
dinosaurian reptiles. With some exceptions, cetaceans are
generally timid, inoffensive animals, active in their movements
and affectionate in their disposition towards one another,
especially the mother towards the young, of which there is
usually but one, or at most two at a time. They are generally
gregarious, swimming in herds or &ldquo;schools,&rdquo; sometimes amounting
to many thousands in number; though some species are
met with either singly or in pairs.</p>

<p>Commercially these animals are of importance on account
of the oil yielded by the blubber of all of them; while whalebone,
spermaceti and ambergris are still more valuable products
yielded by certain species. Within the last few years whalebone
has been sold in America for £2900 per ton, while it is also asserted
that £3000 per ton has been paid for two and a quarter tons at
Aberdeen, although there seems to be some degree of doubt
attaching to the statement. Soon after the middle of the last
century, the price of this commodity was as low as £150 per ton,
but, according to Mr Frank Buckland, it suddenly leapt up to
£620 with the introduction of &ldquo;crinoline&rdquo; into ladies&rsquo; costume,
and it has apparently been on the rise ever since. Ambergris,
which is very largely used in perfumery, is solely a product of
the sperm-whale, and appears to be a kind of biliary calculus.
It generally contains a number of the horny beaks of the cuttle-fishes
and squids upon which these whales chiefly feed. Its
market-price is subject to considerable variation, but from £3 to
£4 per oz. is the usual average for samples of good quality. In
1898 a merchant in Mincing Lane was the owner of a lump of
ambergris weighing 270 &#8468;, which was sold in Paris for about
85 s. per oz., or £18,360.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Whalebone Whales</i>.&mdash;Existing Cetacea are divisible into two
sections, or suborders, the relationships of which are by no means
clearly apparent. The first section is that of the whalebone whales,
or Mystacoceti, in which no functional teeth are developed, although
there are tooth-germs during foetal life. The palate is furnished
with plates of baleen or whalebone; the skull is symmetrical; and
the nasal bones form a roof to the nasal passages, which are directed
upwards and forwards. The maxilla is produced in front of, but not
over, the orbital process of the frontal. The lacrymal is small and
distinct from the jugal. The tympanic is welded with the periotic,
which is attached to the base of the skull by two strong diverging
processes. The olfactory organ is distinctly developed. The two
halves of the lower jaw are arched outwards, their anterior ends
meeting at an angle, and connected by fibrous tissue without any
symphysis. All the ribs at their upper extremity articulate only
with the transverse processes of the vertebrae; their capitular
processes when present not articulating directly with the bodies of
the vertebrae. The sternum is composed of a single piece, and
articulates only with a single pair of ribs; and there are no ossified
sternal ribs. External openings of nostrils distinct from each other,
longitudinal. A short conical caecum.</p>

<p>When in the foetal state these whales have numerous minute
teeth lying in the dental groove of both upper and lower jaws.
They are best developed about the middle of foetal life, after which
they are absorbed, and no trace of them remains at the time of birth.
The whalebone does not make its appearance until after birth;
and consists of a series of flattened horny plates, between three and
four hundred in number, on each side of the palate, with a bare
interval along the middle line. The plates are placed transversely
to the long axis of the palate, with short intervals between them.
Each plate or blade is somewhat triangular in form, with the base
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page771" id="page771"></a>771</span>
attached to the palate and the apex hanging downwards. The outer
edge of the blade is hard and smooth, but the inner edge and apex
fray out into long bristly fibres, so that the roof of the whale&rsquo;s mouth
looks as if covered with hair, as described by Aristotle. At the inner
edge of each principal blade are two or three much smaller or subsidiary
blades. The principal blades are longest near the middle of
the series, and gradually diminish towards the front and back of the
mouth. The horny plates grow from a fibrous and vascular matrix,
which covers the palatal surface of the maxillae, and sends out plate-like
processes, one of which penetrates the base of each blade.
Moreover, the free edges of these processes are covered with long
vascular thread-like papillae, one of which forms the central axis of
each of the hair-like fibres mainly composing the blade. A transverse
section of fresh whalebone shows that it is made up of numbers of
these soft vascular papillae, circular in outline, and surrounded by
concentrically arranged epidermic cells, the whole bound together
by other epidermic cells, that constitute the smooth (so-called
&ldquo;enamel&rdquo;) surface of the blade, which, disintegrating at the free
edge, allows the individual fibres to become loose and assume a
hair-like appearance.</p>

<p>Whalebone really consists of modified papillae of the mucous
membrane of the mouth, with an excessive and horny epithelial
development. The blades are supported and bound together for a
certain distance from their base, by a mass of less hardened epithelium,
secreted by the surface of the palatal membrane or matrix
of the whalebone in the intervals of the plate-like processes. This is
the &ldquo;gum&rdquo; of the whalers. Whalebone varies much in colour in
different species; in some it is almost jet black, in others slate colour,
horn colour, yellow, or even creamy-white. In some descriptions
the blades are variegated with longitudinal stripes of different hues.
It differs also greatly in other respects, being short, thick, coarse,
and stiff in some cases, and greatly elongated and highly elastic in
those species in which it has attained its fullest development. Its
function is to strain the water from the small marine molluscs,
crustaceans, or fish upon which the whales subsist. In feeding, whales
fill the immense mouth with water containing shoals of these small
creatures, and then, on closing the jaws and raising the tongue, so
as to diminish the cavity of the mouth, the water streams out through
the narrow intervals between the hairy fringe of the whalebone
blades, and escapes through the lips, leaving the living prey to be
swallowed.</p>

<p>Although sometimes divided into two families, <i>Balaenidae</i> and
<i>Balaenopteridae</i>, whalebone-whales are best included in a single
family group under the former name. The typical members of this
family are the so-called right-whales, forming the genus <i>Balaena</i>,
in which there are no folds on the throat and chest, and no back-fin;
while the cervical vertebrae are fused into a single mass. The flippers
are short and broad, with five digits; the head is very large and the
whalebone very long and narrow, highly elastic and black; while
the scapula is high, with a distinct coracoid and coronoid process.
This genus contains the well-known Greenland right-whale (<i>B.
mysticetus</i>) of the Arctic seas, the whalebone and oil of which are so
much valued in commerce, and also other whales, distinguished by
having the head somewhat smaller in proportion to the body, with
shorter whalebone and a larger number of vertebrae. These inhabit
the temperate seas of both northern and southern hemispheres, and
have been divided into species in accordance with their geographical
distribution, such as <i>B. biscayensis</i> of the North Atlantic, <i>B. japonica</i>
of the North Pacific, <i>B. australis</i> of the South Atlantic, and <i>B.
antipodarum</i> and <i>novae-zelandiae</i> of the South Pacific; but the
differences between them are so small that they may probably be
regarded as races of a single species, the black whale (<i>B. australis</i>).
On the head these whales carry a peculiar structure which is known
to whalers as the &ldquo;bonnet.&rdquo; This is a large horny excrescence,
worn into hollows like a much-denuded piece of limestone rock,
growing probably in the neighbourhood of the blow-hole. More
than one theory has been suggested to account for its presence.
One suggestion is that it indicates the descent of whales from rhinoceros-like
mammals; another that this species of whale is in the
habit of rubbing against rocks in order to free itself from barnacles,
and thus produces a kind of corn&mdash;although why on the nose alone
is not stated. Dr W.G. Ridewood, however, considers that the
structure is due to the fact that the horny layers which are produced
all over the skin are not shed on this particular spot.</p>

<p>The pigmy whale (<i>Neobalaena marginata</i>) represents a genus
agreeing with the right-whales in the absence of throat-flutings,
and with the rorquals in the presence of a dorsal fin. The cervical
vertebrae are united, and there are only 43 vertebrae altogether.
The flippers are small, narrow, and with only four digits. The ribs
remarkably expanded and flattened; the scapula low and broad,
with completely developed acromion and coracoid processes. The
whalebone is long, slender, elastic and white. The species which
inhabits the South American, Australian and New Zealand seas is
the smallest of the whalebone-whales, being not more than 20 ft. in
length.</p>

<p>In contrast to the preceding is the great grey whale (<i>Rachianectes
glaucus</i>) of the North Pacific, which combines the relatively small
head, elongated shape, and narrow flippers of the fin-whales, with
the smooth throat and absence of a back-fin distinctive of the right-whales.
The whalebone is shorter and coarser than in any other
species. In the skeleton the cervical vertebrae are free, and the first
two ribs on each side expanded and united to form a large bony
shield. In the humpback-whale (<i>Megaptera longimana</i> or <i>boops</i>)
the head is of moderate size, the whalebone-plates are short and
wide, and the cervical vertebrae free. The skin of the throat is
fluted so as to form an expansible pouch; there is a low back-fin;
and the flippers, which have four digits each, are extremely long,
equalling about one-fourth the total length of the animal. The
acromion and coracoid processes of the scapula are rudimentary.
See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Humpback-Whale</a></span>.</p>

<p>The right-whales are built for cruising slowly about in search of
the shoals of small floating invertebrates which form their food, and
are consequently broad in beam, with a float-shaped body and immovable
neck. The humpback is of somewhat similar build, but
with a smaller head, and probably attains considerable speed owing
to the length of its flippers. The finners, or rorquals (<i>Balaenoptera</i>),
which prey largely on fish, are built entirely for speed, and are the
ocean greyhounds of the group. Their bodies are consequently long
and attenuated, and their necks are partially mobile; while they are
furnished with capacious pouches for storing their food. They
chiefly differ from the humpback by the smaller head, long and
slender build, small, narrow, and pointed flippers, each containing
four digits, and the large acromion and coracoid processes to the low
and broad scapula. Rorquals are found in almost every sea. Among
them are the most gigantic of all animals, <i>B. sibbaldi</i>, which attains
the length of 80 ft., and the small <i>B. rostrata</i>, which does not exceed
30. There are certainly four distinct modifications of this genus,
represented by the two just mentioned, and by <i>B. musculus</i> and
<i>B. borealis</i>, all inhabitants of British seas, but the question whether
almost identical forms found in the Indian, Southern and Pacific
Oceans are to be regarded as specifically identical or as distinct
awaits future researches, although some of these have already
received distinct names. See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Rorqual</a></span>.</p>

<p>In the report on the zoology of the &ldquo;Discovery&rdquo; expedition,
published in 1907 by the British Museum, E.A. Wilson describes a
whale frequenting the fringe of the Antarctic ice which indicates
a new generic type. Mainly black in colour, these whales measure
about 20 or 30 ft. in length, and have a tall dorsal fin like that of a
killer.</p>

<p><i>Toothed Whales.</i>&mdash;-The second suborder is represented by the
toothed whales, or Odontoceti, in which there is no whalebone, and
teeth, generally numerous, though sometimes reduced to a single
pair, and occasionally wanting, are normally developed. Unlike
that of the whalebone-whales, the upper surface of the skull is more
or less unsymmetrical. The nasal bones are in the form of nodules or
flattened plates, applied closely to the frontals, and not forming
any part of the roof to the nasal passage, which is directed upwards
and backwards. The olfactory organ is rudimentary or absent.
Hinder end of the maxilla expanded and covering the greater part of
the orbital plate of the frontal bone. Lacrymal bone either inseparable
from the jugal, or, if distinct, large, and forming part of the
roof of the orbit. Tympanic bone not welded with the periotic,
which is usually only attached to the rest of the skull by ligament.
Two halves of the lower jaw nearly straight, expanded in height
posteriorly, with a wide funnel-shaped aperture to the dental canal,
and coming in contact in front by a flat surface of variable length,
but constituting a symphysis. Several of the anterior ribs with
well-developed capitular processes, which articulate with the bodies
of the vertebrae. Sternum almost always composed of several pieces,
placed one behind the other, with which several pairs of ribs are
connected by well-developed cartilaginous or ossified sternal ribs.
External respiratory aperture single, the two nostrils uniting before
they reach the surface, usually in the form of a transverse sub-crescentic
valvular aperture, situated on the top of the head.
Flippers with five digits, though the first and fifth are usually little
developed. No caecum, except in <i>Platanista</i>.</p>

<p>The first family, <i>Physeteridae</i>, is typified by the sperm-whale,
and characterized by the absence of functional teeth in the upper
jaw; the lower teeth being various, and often much reduced in
number. Bones of the skull raised so as to form an elevated prominence
or crest behind the nostrils. Pterygoid bones thick, produced
backwards, meeting in the middle line, and not involuted to form
the outer wall of the post-palatine air-sinuses, but simply hollowed
on their outer side. Transverse processes of the arches of the dorsal
vertebrae, to which the tubercles of the ribs are attached, ceasing
abruptly near the end of the series, and replaced by processes on the
body at a lower level, and serially homologous anteriorly with the
heads of the ribs, and posteriorly with the transverse processes of
the lumbar vertebrae. Costal cartilages not ossified.</p>

<p>The first group, or <i>Physeterinae</i>, includes the sperm-whale itself
and is characterized by the presence of a full series of lower teeth,
which are set in a groove in place of sockets, the groove being imperfectly
divided by partial septa, and the teeth held in place by the
strong, fibrous gum. No distinct lacrymal bone. Skull strikingly
asymmetrical in the region of the nasal apertures, in consequence
of the left opening greatly exceeding the right in size.</p>

teeth on each side, stout, conical, recurved and pointed at the apex
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page772" id="page772"></a>772</span>
until they are worn, without enamel. Upper surface of the skull
concave; its posterior and lateral edges raised into a very high and
greatly compressed semicircular crest or wall (fig. 2). Zygomatic
processes of jugal bones thick and massive. Muzzle greatly elongated,
broad at the base, and gradually tapering to the apex. Lower
jaw exceedingly long and narrow, the symphysis being more than
half the length. Vertebrae: C 7, D 11, L 8, Ca 24; total 50. Atlas,
or first vertebra, free; all the other cervical vertebrae united
by their bodies and spines into a single mass. Eleventh pair of
ribs rudimentary. Head about one-third the length of the body;
very massive, high and truncated, and rather compressed in front;
owing its huge size and form mainly to the accumulation of a mass
of fatty tissue filling the large hollow on the upper surface of the
skull and overlying the long muzzle. The single blow-hole is longitudinal,
slightly S-shaped, and placed at the upper and
anterior extremity of the head to the left side of the middle
line. The opening of the mouth is on the under side of the
head, considerably behind the end of the snout. Flippers
short, broad and truncated. Dorsal fin represented by a low
protuberance. See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Sperm-Whale</a></span>.</p>

<p>In the lesser or pigmy sperm-whale (<i>Cogia  breviceps</i>)
there may be a pair of rudimentary teeth in the upper jaw,
while on each side of the lower jaw there are from 9 to 12
rather long, slender, pointed and curved teeth, with a coating
of enamel. Upper surface of the skull concave, with
thick, raised, posterior and lateral margins, massive and rounded
at their anterior terminations above the orbits. Muzzle not longer
than the cranial position of the skull, broad at the base, and rapidly
tapering to the apex. Zygomatic process of the jugal rod-like.
Lower jaw with symphysis less than half its length. Vertebrae:
C 7, D 13 or 14, L and Ca 30; total 50 or 51. All the cervical vertebrae
united by their bodies and arches. The head is about one-sixth
of the length of the body, and obtusely pointed in front; the
mouth small and placed far below the apex of the snout; the blow-hole
crescentic, and placed obliquely on the crown of the head in advance
of the eyes and to the left of the middle line; while the flippers are
bluntly sickle-shaped, and the back-fin triangular. This species
attains a length of from 9 to 13 ft.</p>

<p>A second subfamily is represented by the bottle-noses and beaked
whales, and known as the <i>Ziphiinae</i>. In this group the lower teeth
are rudimentary and concealed in the gum, except one, or rarely
two, pairs which may be largely developed, especially in the male.
There is a distinct lacrymal bone. Externally the mouth is produced
into a slender rostrum or beak, from above which the rounded
eminence formed by a cushion of fat resting on the cranium in front
of the blow-hole rises somewhat abruptly. The blow-hole is single,
crescentic and median, as in the <i>Delphinidae</i>. Flippers small, ovate,
with five digits moderately well developed. A small obtuse dorsal
fin situated considerably behind the middle of the back. Longitudinal
grooves on each side of the skin of the throat, diverging
posteriorly, and nearly meeting in front. In external characters
and habits the whales of this group closely resemble each other.
They appear to be almost exclusively feeders on cuttle-fishes, and
occur either singly, in pairs, or in small herds. By their dental and
osteological characters they are easily separated into four genera.</p>

<p>In the first of these, <i>Hyperoödon</i>, or bottle-nose, there is a small
conical pointed tooth at the apex of each half of the lower jaw,
concealed by the gum during life. Skull with the upper ends of the
premaxillae rising suddenly behind the nostrils to the vertex and
expanded laterally, their outer edges curving backwards and their
anterior surfaces arching forwards and overhanging the nostrils;
the right larger than the left. Nasal bones lying in the hollow
between the upper extremities of the premaxillae, strongly concave
in the middle line and in front; their outer edges, especially that of
the right, expanded over the front of the inner border of the maxilla.
Very high longitudinal crests on the maxillae at the base of the beak,
extending backwards almost to the nostrils, approaching each other
in the middle line above; sometimes compressed and sometimes so
massive that their inner edges come almost in contact. Preorbital
notch distinct, and mesethmoid cartilage slightly ossified. Vertebrae:
C 7, D 9, L 10, Ca 19; total 45. All the cervical vertebrae
united. Upper surface of the head in front of the blow-hole very
prominent and rounded, rising abruptly from above the small,
distinct snout. Two species are known. See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bottle-nose Whale</a></span>.</p>

<p>The typical representative of the beaked whales is <i>Ziphius cuvieri</i>,
in which there is a single conical tooth of moderate size on each side
close to the anterior extremity of the lower jaw, directed forwards
and upwards. Skull with the premaxillae immediately in front and
at the sides of the nostrils expanded, hollowed, with elevated lateral
margins, the posterior ends rising to the vertex and curving forwards,
the right being considerably more developed than the left. The
conjoint nasals form a pronounced symmetrical eminence at the top of
the skull, projecting forwards over the nostrils, flat above, prominent
and rounded in the middle line in front, and separated by a notch
on each side from the premaxillae. Preorbital notch not distinct.
Rostrum (seen from above) triangular, tapering from the base to the
apex; upper and outer edges of maxillae at base of rostrum raised
into low roughened tuberosities. Mesethmoid cartilage densely
ossified in adult age, and coalescing with the surrounding bones of
the rostrum. Vertebrae: C 7, D 10, L 10, Ca 22; total 49. The
three anterior cervical vertebrae united, the rest free.</p>

<p>In the numerous species of the allied genus <i>Mesoplodon</i> there is a
much-compressed and pointed tooth in each half of the lower jaw,
variously situated, but generally at some distance behind the apex;
its point directed upwards, and often somewhat backwards, occasionally
developed to a great size. In the skull the region round the
nostrils is as in <i>Hyperoödon</i>, except that the nasals are narrow and
more sunk between the upper ends of the premaxillae; like those of
<i>Hyperoödon</i>, they are concave in the middle line in front and above.
No maxillary tuberosities. Preorbital notch not very distinct.
Rostrum long and narrow. Mesethmoid in the adult ossified in its
entire length, and coalescing with the surrounding bones. Vertebrae:
C 7, D 10, L 10 or 11, Ca 19 or 20; total 46 to 48. Two
or three anterior cervicals united, the rest usually free.</p>

<p>Though varying in form, the lower teeth of the different
members of this genus agree in their essential structure,
having a small and pointed enamel-covered crown, composed
of dentine, which, instead of surmounting a root of
the ordinary character, is raised upon a solid mass of osteo-dentine,
the continuous growth of which greatly alters the
form and general appearance of the tooth as age advances,
as in the case of <i>M. layardi</i>, where the long, narrow, flat, strap-like
teeth, curving inwards at their extremities, meet over
the rostrum, and interfere with the movements of the jaw. In one
species (<i>M. grayi</i>) a row of minute, conical, pointed teeth, like
those of ordinary Dolphins, 17 to 19 in number, is present even in
the adults, on each side of the middle part of the upper jaw, but
embedded by their roots only in the gum, and not in bony sockets.
This, with the frequent presence of rudimentary teeth in other
species of this genus, indicates that the beaked whales are derived
from ancestral forms with teeth of normal character in both jaws.
The species are distributed in both northern and southern hemispheres,
but most frequent in the latter. Among them are <i>M. bidens</i>,
<i>M. europaeas</i>, <i>M. densirostris</i>, <i>M. layardi</i>, <i>M. grayi</i> and <i>M. hectori</i>;
but there is still much to be learned with regard to their characters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page773" id="page773"></a>773</span>
and distribution. This group was abundant in the Pliocene age, as
attested by the frequency with which the imperishable long, cylindrical
rostrum of the skull, of more than ivory denseness, is found
among the rolled and waterworn animal remains which compose
the &ldquo;bone-bed&rdquo; at the base of the Red Crag of Suffolk.</p>

<p>Finally, in Arnoux&rsquo;s beaked whale (<i>Berardius arnouxi</i>), of New
Zealand, which grows to a length of 30 ft., there are two moderate-sized,
compressed, pointed teeth, on each side of the symphysis
of the lower jaw, with their summits directed forwards, the anterior
being the larger of the two and close to the front of the jaw. Upper
ends of the premaxillae nearly symmetrical, moderately elevated,
slightly expanded, and not curved forward over the nostrils. Nasals
broad, massive and rounded, of nearly equal size, forming the vertex
of the skull, flattened in front, most prominent in the middle line.
Preorbital notch distinct. Rostrum long and narrow. Mesethmoid
partially ossified. Small rough eminences on the outer edge of the
upper surface of the maxillae at base of rostrum. Vertebrae:
C 7, D 10, L 12, Ca 19; total 48. The three anterior cervicals
welded, the rest free and well developed. Apparently this whale
has the power of thrusting its teeth up and down, exposing them to
view when attacked.</p>

<p>In a family by themselves&mdash;the <i>Platinistidae</i>&mdash;are placed three
cetaceans which differ from the members of the preceding and the
following groups in the mode of articulation of the ribs with the
vertebrae, as the tubercular and capitular articulations, distinct at
the commencement of the series, gradually blend together, as in
most mammals. The cervical vertebrae are all free. The lacrymal
bone is not distinct from the jugal. The jaws are long and narrow,
with numerous teeth in both; the symphysis of the lower one
exceeding half its length. Externally the head is divided from the
body by a slightly constricted neck. Pectoral limbs broad and
truncated. Dorsal fin small or obsolete. In habits these dolphins are
fluviatile or estuarine. In the Indian susu, or Ganges dolphin
(<i>Platanista gangetica</i>), the teeth number about <span class="spp">30</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">30</span>  on each side, are
set near together, are rather large, cylindrical, and sharp-pointed
in the young, but in old animals acquire a large laterally compressed
base, which in the posterior part of the series becomes
irregularly divided into roots. As the conical enamel-covered crown
wears away, the teeth of the young and old animals have a totally
different appearance. The beak and tooth-bearing portion of the
lower jaw are so narrow that the teeth of the two sides are almost
in contact. Maxillae supporting large, incurved, compressed bony
crests, which overarch the nostrils and base of the rostrum, and
almost meet in the middle line above. Orbits very small and eyes
rudimentary, without crystalline lens. Blow-hole longitudinal,
linear. Vertebrae: C 7, D 11, L 8, Ca 25; total 51. A small caecum.

<p>The last family of existing cetaceans is the above-mentioned
<i>Delphinidae</i>, which includes the true dolphins, porpoises, grampuses
and their relatives. As a rule there are numerous teeth in both jaws;
and the pterygoid bones of the skull are short, thin and involuted
to form with a process of the palate bone the outer wall of the post-palatine
air-sinus. Symphysis of lower jaw short, or moderate, never
exceeding one-third the length of the jaw. Lacrymal bone not
distinct from the jugal. Transverse processes of the dorsal vertebrae
gradually transferred from the arches to the bodies of the
vertebrae without any sudden break, and becoming posteriorly
continuous serially with the transverse processes of the lumbar
vertebrae. Anterior ribs attached to the
transverse process by the tubercle, and to
the body of the vertebra by the head; the
latter attachment lost in the posterior ribs.
Sternal ribs ossified. The blow-hole is transverse,
crescentic, with the horns of the

<p>First on the long list is the narwhal,
<i>Monodon monoceros</i>, in which, apart from
some irregular rudimentary teeth, the dentition
is reduced to a single pair of teeth which
lie horizontally in the maxilla, and in the
female remain permanently concealed within
the socket, so that this sex is practically
toothless, while in the male (fig. 8), the
right tooth usually remains similarly concealed
while the left is immensely developed,
attaining a length equal to more than half
that of the entire animal, projecting horizontally
from the head in the form of a
cylindrical, or slightly tapering, pointed
tusk, without enamel, and with the surface
marked by spiral grooves and ridges, running
in a sinistral direction. Vertebrae: C 7,

No dorsal fin. See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Narwhal</a></span>.</p>

<p>Closely allied is the beluga or white-whale
(<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>), of the Arctic seas,
in which, however, there are from eight to
ten pairs of teeth in each jaw, occupying
the anterior three-fourths of the rostrum and
corresponding portion of the lower jaw,
rather small, conical, and pointed when
unworn, but usually become obliquely truncated,
separated by intervals considerably
wider than the diameter of the tooth, and
implanted obliquely, the crowns inclining
forwards especially in the upper jaw. Skull
rather narrow and elongated, depressed. Premaxillae
convex in front of the nostrils.
Rostrum about equal in length to the cranial
portion of the skull, triangular, broad at the
base, and gradually contracting towards the
apex, where it is somewhat curved downwards.
Vertebrae: C 7, D 11, L 9, Ca 23;

place. See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Beluga</a></span>.</p>

<p>In all the remaining genera of <i>Delphinidae</i>
the cervical region of the vertebral column is
very short, and the first two, and usually
more, of the vertebrae are firmly united.
The common porpoise (<i>Phocaena communis</i>,
or <i>P. phocaena</i>) is the typical representative
of the first genus, in which the teeth
vary from <span class="spp">18</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">18</span>  to <span class="spp">25</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">25</span> , are small, and occupy
nearly the whole length of the rostrum, with
compressed, spade-shaped crowns, separated
from the root by a constricted neck.
Rostrum rather shorter than the cranium
proper, broad at the base and tapering towards
the apex. Premaxillae raised into
tuberosities in front of the nostrils. The
frontal bones form a somewhat square elevated
protuberance in the middle line of the
skull behind the nostrils, rising above the flattened nasals. Symphysis
of lower jaw very short. Vertebrae: C 7, D 13, L 14, Ca 30;
total 64. First to sixth cervical vertebrae and sometimes the seventh
also, coalesced. Flippers of moderate size, oval, slightly sickle-shaped,
with the second and third digits nearly equal in length, and
the fourth and fifth well developed, but shorter. Head short,
moderately rounded in front of the blow-hole. Dorsal fin near the
middle of the back, triangular; its height considerably less than
the length of the base; its anterior edge frequently furnished with
one or more rows of conical horny tubercles.</p>

<p>The porpoise, which is so common in British waters and the
Atlantic, seldom enters the Mediterranean, and apparently never
resides there. There is, however, a porpoise in the Black Sea, which,
according to Dr O. Abel, is entitled to rank as a distinct species, with
the name of <i>Phocaena relicta</i>. This Black Sea porpoise is readily
distinguished from the Atlantic species by the contour of the profile
of the head, which, in place of forming a continuous curve from the
muzzle to what represents the neck, has a marked prominence above
the angle of the mouth, followed by an equally marked depression.
The teeth are also different in form and number. The absence of
porpoises from the Mediterranean is explained by Dr Abel on account
of the greater saltness of that sea as compared with the ocean in
general; his idea being that these cetaceans are near akin to fresh-water
members of the group, and therefore unsuited to withstand
an excessively saline medium. From the Taman Peninsula, on the
north shore of the Black Sea, the same writer has described an extinct
type of ancestral porpoise, under the name of <i>Palaeophocaena andrussowi</i>.
Another species is the wholly black <i>P. spinipennis</i>, typically
from South America. Black is also the hue of the Indian porpoise
(<i>Neophocaena phocaenoides</i>), which wants a dorsal fin, and has
eighteen pairs of teeth rather larger than those of the ordinary
porpoise. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Porpoise</a></span>.)</p>

considerably exceeding its vertical height.</p>

<p>Next comes the ca&rsquo;ing whale, or black-fish (<i>Globicephalus melas</i>),
with about ten pairs of upper and lower teeth. Cranial and dental
characters generally like those of <i>Orca</i>, except that the roots of the

Head in front of the blow-hole high, and compressed anteriorly, the
snout truncated. See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ca&rsquo;ing Whale</a></span>.</p>

<p>Risso&rsquo;s dolphin, <i>Grampus griseus</i>, represents another genus,
characterized by the absence of teeth in the upper and the small
number of these in the lower jaw (3 to 7 on each side,
and confined to the region of the symphysis). Vertebrae: C 7,
D 12, L 19, Ca 30; total 68. General external characters much
as in <i>Globicephalus</i>, but the fore part of the head less rounded,
and the flippers less elongated. <i>G. griseus</i> is about 13 ft. long,
and remarkable for its great variability of colour. It has been
found, though rarely, in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean.</p>

<p>The common dolphin (<i>Delphinus delphis</i>) is the typical representative
of a large group of relatively small species, some of
which are wholly marine, while others are more or less completely
fluviatile. They are divided into a number of genera, such as <i>Prodelphinus</i>,
<i>Steno</i>, <i>Lagenorhynchus</i>, <i>Cephalorhynchus</i>, <i>Tursiops</i>, &amp;c., best
distinguished from one another by the number and size of the teeth,
the form and relations of the bones on the hinder part of the palate,
the length of the beak and of the union of the two halves of the lower
jaw, and the number of vertebrae. For the distinctive characters
of these genera the reader may refer to one of the works mentioned
below; and it must suffice to state that, collectively, all these
dolphins are characterized by the following features. The teeth
are numerous in both jaws, and more than <span class="spp">20</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">20</span>  in number, occupying
nearly the whole length of the rostrum, and small, close-set, conical,
pointed and slightly curved. Rostrum more or less elongated, and
pointed in front, usually considerably longer than the cranial portion
of the skull. Vertebrae: C 7, D 12-14, L and Ca variable; total
51 to 90. Flippers of moderate size, narrow, pointed, somewhat
sickle-shaped, with the first digit rudimentary, the second longest,
third nearly equal, and the fourth and fifth extremely short. Externally
the head shows a distinct beak or pointed snout, marked
off from the antenasal fatty elevation by a V-shaped groove. Dorsal
fin rather large, triangular or sickle-shaped, rarely wanting. A
curiously marked brown and white species, perhaps referable to
<i>Lagenorhynchus</i> is found on the fringe of the Antarctic ice (see
report on the zoology of the &ldquo;Discovery,&rdquo; published in 1907 by the
British Museum). See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Dolphin</a></span>.</p>

<p class="pt2 center"><i>Extinct Cetacea.</i></p>

<p>At present we are totally in the dark as to the origin of the whalebone-whales,
not being even assured that they are derived from the
same stock as the toothed whales. It is noteworthy,
however, that some of the fossil representatives of the
latter have nasal bones of a type recalling those of the
former. Such fossil whalebone-whales as are known occur
in Pliocene, and Miocene formations are either referable to
existing genera, or to more or less nearly related extinct ones,
such as <i>Plesiocetus</i>, <i>Herpetocetus</i> and <i>Cetotherium</i>.</p>

<p>The toothed whales, on the other hand, are very largely
represented in a fossil state, reaching as low in the geological
series as the upper Cretaceous. Many of these present much
more generalized characters than their modern representatives,
while others indicate apparently a transition towards
the still more primitive zeuglodonts, which, as will be
shown later, are themselves derived from the creodont
Carnivora. In the Pliocene deposits of Belgium and England
are preserved the teeth and other remains of a number of
cetaceans, such as <i>Physodon</i>, <i>Encetus</i>, <i>Dinoziphius</i>, <i>Hoplocetus</i>,
<i>Balaenodon</i> and <i>Scaldicetus</i>, more or less nearly related to the sperm-whale,
but presenting several primitive characters. A complete
skull of a member of this group from the Tertiary deposits of Patagonia,
at first referred to <i>Physodon</i>, but subsequently to <i>Scaldicetus</i>,
has a full series of enamelled teeth in the upper jaw; and it is probable
that the same was the case in other forms. This entails either
a modification of the definition of the <i>Physeteridae</i> as given above,
or the creation of a separate family for these primitive sperm-whales.
In other cases, however, as in the Miocene <i>Prophyseter</i> and <i>Placoziphius</i>,
the anterior portion or the whole of the upper jaw had
already become toothless; and these forms are regarded as indicating
the descent of the sperm-whales from the under-mentioned
<i>Squalodon</i>. The beaked whales, again, are believed to be independently
descended from the latter type, <i>Berardius</i> being traced
into the Miocene <i>Mioziphius</i>, <i>Anoplonassa</i> and <i>Palaeoziphius</i>, the
last of which shows signs in its dentition of approximating to the
complicated tooth-structure of the squalodonts.</p>

<p>Another line of descent from the latter, apparently culminating
in the modern <i>Platanistidae</i>, is represented by the family
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page775" id="page775"></a>775</span>
<i>Eurhinodelphidae</i>, typified by the European Miocene <i>Eurhinodelphis</i>,
but also including the contemporary Patagonian <i>Argyrocetus</i> and the
nearly allied European <i>Cyrtodelphis</i>. All these were very long-beaked
dolphins; and in <i>Argyrocetus</i>, at all events, the occipital condyles,
instead of being closely pressed to the skull, are as prominent as
in ordinary mammals, while the nasal bones, instead of forming
mere rudimentary nodules, were squared and roofed over the hind
part of the nasal chamber.</p>

<p>In the Miocene <i>Squalodon</i>, representing the family <i>Squalodontidae</i>,
the dentition is differentiated into incisors, canines and cheek-teeth,
the hinder ones of the latter series having double roots and
compressed crowns carrying serrations on the hinder edge; generally
the dental formula has been given as i. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> , c. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span> , p. <span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">4</span> , m. <span class="spp">7</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">7</span> , the
single-rooted cheek-teeth being regarded as premolars and those with
double roots as molars. Dr Abel is, however, of opinion that the
formula is better represented as i. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> , c. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span> , p. <span class="spp">8 or 9</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">9</span>, m. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span> ; the teeth
reckoned as molars corresponding to those of the creodont Carnivora.
The single-rooted cheek-teeth are regarded as due, not to the division
of double-rooted ones, but to the fusion of the two roots of teeth
of the latter type. In <i>Squalodon</i> the nasal bones were of the modern
nodular type, but in the Miocene Patagonian <i>Prosqualodon</i> they
partially covered the nasal chamber.</p>

<p>At present there is a gap between the most primitive squalodonts
and the Eocene zeuglodonts (<i>Zeuglodontidae</i>), which are regarded by
Messrs Max Weber, O. Abel and C.W. Andrews as the direct
forerunners of the modern-toothed whales, forming the suborder
<i>Archaeoceti</i>. It is, however, right to mention that some
authorities refuse to admit the relation of the Archaeoceti to the
whales.</p>

<p>In the typical zeuglodonts the long and flat skull has large temporal
fossae, a strong sagittal crest, a long beak formed mainly by the
premaxillae (in place of the maxillae, as in modern whales), and long
nasal bones covering over the nasal chamber, so that the nostrils
opened about half-way down the beak. All the cervical vertebrae
were free. Normally the dentition in the typical genus <i>Zeuglodon</i>
(which is common to the Eocene of North America and Egypt)
is i. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> , c. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span> , p. <span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">4</span> , m. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> ; the cheek-teeth being two-rooted, with
compressed pointed crowns, of which the fore-and-aft edges are coarsely
serrated. In the Egyptian <i>Zeuglodon osiris</i> the number of the molars
is, however, reduced to <span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> , while some of the earlier cheek-teeth have
become single-rooted, as in the squalodonts. The probable transitional
form between the latter and the zeuglodonts is the small
<i>Microzeuglodon caucasicus</i> described by the present writer, from the
Caucasus. As regards the origin of the zeuglodonts themselves,
remains discovered in the Eocene formations of Egypt indicate a
practically complete transition, so far at least as dental characters
are concerned, from these whale-like creatures to the creodont
Carnivora. In the earliest type, <i>Protocetus</i>, the skull is practically
that of a zeuglodont, the snout being in fact more elongated than
in some of the earliest representatives of the latter, although the
nostrils are placed nearer the tip. The incisors are unknown, but
the cheek-teeth are essentially those of a creodont, none of them
having acquired the serrated edges distinctive of the typical zeuglodonts;
and the hinder premolars and molars retaining the three
roots of the creodonts. In the somewhat later <i>Prozeuglodon</i> the
skull is likewise essentially of the zeuglodont type, although the
nostrils have shifted a little more backwards; as regards the cheek-teeth,
which have acquired serrated crowns, the premolars at any
rate retain the inner buttress supported by a distinct third root, so
that they are precisely intermediate between <i>Protocetus</i> and <i>Zeuglodon</i>.
Yet another connecting form is <i>Eocetus</i>, a very large animal
from nearly the same horizon as <i>Prozeuglodon</i>; its skull approaching
that of <i>Zeuglodon</i> as regards the backward position of the nostrils,
although the cheek-teeth are of the creodont type, having inner, or
third, roots. It is noteworthy that <i>Zeuglodon</i> apparently occurs in
the same beds as these intermediate types.</p>

<p>It follows from the foregoing that if zeuglodonts are the ancestors
of the true Cetacea&mdash;and the probability that they are so is very
great&mdash;the latter are derived from primitive Carnivora, and not, as
has been suggested, from herbivorous Ungulata. The idea that the
zeuglodonts were provided with a bony armour does not appear
to be supported by recent discoveries.</p>

under Charles V. in Italy and Germany, but retired from the
army in 1545 to settle in Seville. Soon afterwards, however,
he sailed for Mexico, where he resided for some ten years; he
appears to have visited Seville in 1557, and to have returned
to Mexico, where he died at some date previous to 1575. A
follower of Boscan and Garcilaso de la Vega, a friend of Jerónimo

of the Italian school and, under the name of Vandalio, wrote
an extensive series of poems in the newly introduced metres;

<p><span class="bold">CETTE,<a name="ar34" id="ar34"></a></span> a seaport of southern France in the department of
Hérault, 18 m. S.W. of Montpellier by the Southern railway.
Pop. (1906) 32,659. After Marseilles it is the principal commercial
port on the south coast of France. The older part of
Cette occupies the foot and slope of the Mont St Clair (the
ancient <i>Mons Setius</i>), a hill 590 ft. in height, situated on a
tongue of land that lies between the Mediterranean and the
lagoon of Thau. This quarter with its wide streets and lofty
stone buildings is bounded on the east by the Canal de Cette,
which leads from the lagoon of Thau to the Old Basin and the
outer harbour. Across the canal lie the newer quarters, which
chiefly occupy two islands separated from each other by a wet
dock and limited on the east by the Canal Maritime, parallel to
the Canal de Cette. A lateral canal unites the northern ends
of the two main canals. A breakwater running W.S.W. and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page776" id="page776"></a>776</span>
E.N.E. protects the entrance to the harbour, which is one of
the safest in France. The outer port and the Old Basin are
enclosed by a mole to the south and by a jetty to the east.
Behind the outer port lies an inner and more recent basin which
communicates with the Canal Maritime. The entire area of the
harbour, including the canals, is 111 acres with a quayage
length of over 8000 yds. The public institutions of Cette
include tribunals of commerce and of maritime commerce,
councils of arbitration in commercial and fishing affairs, an
exchange and chamber of commerce, a branch of the Bank of
France and a large hospital. There are also a communal college,
a naval school, and schools of music, commerce and industry,
and navigation. Cette is much resorted to for sea-bathing. The
town is connected with Lyons by the canal from the Rhone to
Cette, and with Bordeaux by the Canal du Midi, and is a
junction of the Southern and Paris-Lyon railways. The shipping
trade is carried on with South America, the chief ports of the
Mediterranean, and especially with Spain. The chief exports
are wines and brandy, chemical products, skins and soap; the
chief imports are wine, cereals, coal, timber, petroleum, sulphur,
tar and chemical substances. In the five years 1901-1905 the
average annual value of imports was £3,720,000 (£4,980,000 in
years 1896-1900), of exports £1,427,000 (£1,237,000 in 1896-1900).
More than 400 small craft are employed in the sardine, tunny,
cod and other fisheries. Large quantities of shell-fish are
obtained from the lagoon of Thau. There are factories for the
pickling of sardines, for the manufacture of liqueurs and casks,
and for the treatment of sulphur, phosphates, and nitrate of
soda. The Schneider Company of Creusot also have metallurgical
works at Cette, and the establishments for making wine
give employment to thousands. The port of Cette was created
in 1666 by the agency of Colbert, minister of Louis XIV., and
according to the plans of Vauban; toward the end of the 17th
century its development was aided by the opening of the Canal
du Midi.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CETTIGNE<a name="ar35" id="ar35"></a></span> (Servian, <i>Tsetinye</i>; also written <i>Cettinje</i>, <i>Tzetinje</i>,
and <i>Tsettinye</i>), the capital of Montenegro; in a narrow plain
deeply sunk in the heart of the limestone mountains, at a height
of 2093 ft. above the sea. Pop. (1900) about 3200. The surrounding
country is bare and stony, with carefully cultivated
patches of rich red soil among the crevices of the rock. In
winter it is often so deeply covered with snow as to be well-nigh
inaccessible, while in spring and autumn it is frequently flooded
by the waters of a small brook which becomes a torrent after
rain or a thaw. Cettigne itself is little more than a walled
village, consisting of a cluster of whitewashed cottages and
some unadorned public buildings. These include a church;
a fortified monastery which was founded in 1478, but so often
burned and rebuilt as to seem quite modern, and which is
visited by pilgrims to the tomb of Peter I. (1782-1830); residences
for the archimandrite and the <i>vladika</i> or metropolitan
of Cettigne; a palace built in 1863, which accommodates the
ministries; the court of appeal, and a school modelled on the
gymnasia of Germany and Austria; the newer palaces of the
prince and his heir; foreign legations; barracks; a seminary
for priests and teachers, established by the tsar Alexander II.
(1855-1881), with a very successful girls&rsquo; school founded and
endowed by the tsaritsa Marie; a library and reading-room;
a theatre, a museum and a hospital. In an open space near
the old palace stood the celebrated plane tree, beneath which
Prince Nicholas gave audience to his subjects, and administered
justice until the closing years of the 19th century. A zigzag
highway, regarded as a triumph of engineering, winds through
the mountain passes between Cettigne and the Austrian seaport
of Cattaro; and other good roads give access to the richest
parts of the interior. There is, however, little trade, though
mineral waters are manufactured.</p>

<p>Cettigne owes its origin to Ivan the Black, who was
forced, towards the end of the 15th century, to withdraw from
Zhabliak, his former capital. It has often been taken and
sacked by the Turks, but has seldom been occupied by them
for long.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CETYWAYO<a name="ar37" id="ar37"></a></span> (&emsp;&emsp;?-1884), king of the Zulus, was the eldest
son of King Umpande or Panda, and a nephew of the two
previous kings, Dingaan and Chaka. Cetywayo was a young
man when in 1840 his father was placed on the throne by the
aid of the Natal Boers; and three years later Natal became
a British colony. Cetywayo had inherited much of the military
talent of his uncle Chaka, the organizer of the Zulu military
system, and chafed under his father&rsquo;s peaceful policy towards
his British and Boer neighbours. Suspecting Panda of favouring
a younger son, Umbulazi, as his successor, Cetywayo made
war on his brother, whom he defeated and slew at a great battle
on the banks of the Tugela in December 1856. In the following
year, at an assembly of the Zulus, it was resolved that Panda
should retire from the management of the affairs of the nation,
which were entrusted to Cetywayo, though the old chief kept
the title of king. Cetywayo was, however, suspicious of the
Natal government, which afforded protection to two of his
brothers. The feeling of distrust was removed in 1861 by a
visit from Mr (afterwards Sir) Theophilus Shepstone, secretary
for native affairs in Natal, who induced Panda to proclaim
Cetywayo publicly as the future king. Friendly relations were
then maintained between the Zulus and Natal for many years.
In 1872 Panda died, and Cetywayo was declared king, August
1873, in the presence of Shepstone, to whom he made solemn
promises to live at peace with his neighbours and to govern his
people more humanely. These promises were not kept. Not
only were numbers of his own people wantonly slain (Cetywayo
returning defiant messages to the governor of Natal when
remonstrated with), and the military system of Chaka and
Dingaan strengthened, but he had a feud with the Transvaal
Boers as to the possession of the territory between the Buffalo
and Pongola rivers, and encouraged the chief Sikukuni (Secocoeni)
in his struggle against the Boers. This feud with the Boers was
inherited by the British government on the annexation of the
Transvaal in 1877. Cetywayo&rsquo;s attitude became menacing; he
allowed a minor chief to make raids into the Transvaal, and
seized natives within the Natal border.</p>

<p>Sir Bartle Frere, who became high commissioner of South
Africa in March 1877, found evidence which convinced him that
the Kaffir revolt of that year on the eastern border of Cape
Colony was part of a design or desire &ldquo;for a general and
simultaneous rising of Kaffirdom against white civilization&rdquo;; and
the Kaffirs undoubtedly looked to Cetywayo and the Zulus as
the most redoubtable of their champions. In December 1878
Frere sent the Zulu king an ultimatum, which, while awarding
him the territory he claimed from the Boers, required him to
make reparation for the outrages committed within the British
borders, to receive a British resident, to disband his regiments,
and to allow his young men to marry without the necessity
of having first &ldquo;washed their spears.&rdquo; Cetywayo, who had
found a defender in Bishop Colenso, vouchsafed no reply, and
Lord Chelmsford entered Zululand, at the head of 13,000 troops,
on the 11th of January 1879 to enforce the British demands.
The disaster of Isandhlwana and the defence of Rorke&rsquo;s Drift
signalized the commencement of the campaign, but on the 4th
of July the Zulus were utterly routed at Ulundi. Cetywayo
became a fugitive, but was captured on the 28th of August. His
kingdom was divided among thirteen chiefs and he himself
taken to Cape Town, whence he was brought to London in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page777" id="page777"></a>777</span>
August 1882. He remained in England less than a month,
during which time the government (the second Gladstone
administration) announced that they had decided upon his
restoration. To his great disappointment, however, restoration
proved to refer only to a portion of his old kingdom. Even
there one of his kinsmen and chief enemies, Usibepu, was allowed
to retain the territory allotted to him in 1879. Cetywayo was
reinstalled on the 29th of January 1883 by Shepstone, but his
enemies, headed by Usibepu, attacked him within a week, and
after a struggle of nearly a year&rsquo;s duration he was defeated and
his kraal destroyed. He then took refuge in the Native Reserve,
where he died on the 8th of February 1884. For a quarter of a
century he had been the most conspicuous native figure in South
Africa, and had been the cause of long and bitter political
controversy in Great Britain.</p>

<p>His son <span class="sc">Dinizulu</span> afterwards attempted to become king, was
exiled (1889) to St Helena, permitted to return (1898), and
granted the position of a chief. In December 1907 Dinizulu
was imprisoned at Maritzburg, being suspected of complicity
in the revolt which had occurred in Zululand the previous
year. He was kept many months waiting trial, there being
considerable friction between the colonial government and the
British government over the incident. He was eventually
brought to trial in November 1908 before a special court, his
defence (to the cost of which the British government contributed
£2000) being undertaken by Mr W.P. Schreiner. The trial was
not concluded until March 1909. The charge of high treason
was not proved, but Dinizulu was convicted of harbouring rebels
and was sentenced to four years&rsquo; imprisonment.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CEUTA<a name="ar38" id="ar38"></a></span> (Arabic <i>Sebta</i>), a Spanish military and convict station
and seaport on the north coast of Morocco, in 35° 54&prime; N., 5° 18&prime;
W. Pop. about 13,000. It is situated on a promontory connected
with the mainland by a narrow isthmus. This promontory
marks the south-eastern end of the straits of Gibraltar,
which between Ceuta and Gibraltar have a width of 14 m.
The promontory terminates in a bold headland, the Montagne
des Singes, with seven distinct peaks. Of these the highest
is the Monte del Hacko, the ancient <i>Abyla</i>, one of the &ldquo;Pillars
of Hercules,&rdquo; which faces Gibraltar and rises 636 ft. above the
sea. On the westernmost point&mdash;Almina, 476 ft. high&mdash;is a
lighthouse with a light visible for 23 m. Ceuta consists of two
quarters, the old town, covering the low ground of the isthmus,
and the modern town, built on the hills forming the north and
west faces of the peninsula. Between the old and new quarters
and on the north side of the isthmus lies the port. The public
buildings in the town, thoroughly Spanish in its character, are
not striking: they include the cathedral (formerly a mosque),
the governor&rsquo;s palace, the town hall, barracks, and the convict
prison in the old convent of San Francisco. Ceuta has been
fortified seaward, the works being furnished with modern
artillery intended to command the entrance to the Mediterranean.
Landward are three lines of defence, the inner line stretching
completely across the isthmus. These fortifications, which date
from the time of the Portuguese occupation, have been partly
modernized. The citadel, El Hacho, built on the neck of the
isthmus, dates from the 15th century. The garrison consists of
between 3000 and 4000 men, inclusive of a disciplinary corps
of military convicts. Of the rest of the population about 2000
are civilian convicts; and there are colonies of Jews, negroes
and Moors, the last including descendants of Moors transferred
to Ceuta from Oran when Spain abandoned that city in 1796.</p>

<p>Ceuta occupies in part the site of a Carthaginian colony,
which was succeeded by a Roman colony said to have been called
<i>Ad Septem Fratres</i> and also <i>Exilissa</i> or <i>Lissa Civitas</i>.
From the Romans the town passed to the Vandals and afterwards
to Byzantium, the emperor Justinian restoring its fortifications
in 535. In 618 the town, then known as <i>Septon</i>, fell into the
hands of the Visigoths. It was the last stronghold in North
Africa which held out against the Arabs. At that date (<span class="scs">A.D.</span>
711) the governor of the town was the Count Julian who, in
revenge for the betrayal of his daughter by King Roderick of
Toledo, invited the Arabs to cross the straits under Tarik and
conquer Spain for Islam. By the Arabs the town was called
<i>Cibta</i> or <i>Sebta</i>, hence the Spanish form <i>Ceuta</i>. From
the date of its occupation by the Arabs the town had a stormy history,
being repeatedly captured by rival Berber and Spanish-Moorish
dynasties. It became nevertheless an important commercial
and industrial city, being noted for its brass ware, its trade in
ivory, gold and slaves. It is said to have been the first place
in the West where a paper manufactory was established. In
1415 the town was captured by the Portuguese under John I.,
among those taking part in the attack being Prince Henry
&ldquo;the Navigator&rdquo; and two of his brothers, who were knighted
on the day following in the mosque (hastily dedicated as a
Christian church). Ceuta passed to Spain in 1580 on the
subjugation of Portugal by Philip II., and was definitely assigned
to the Spanish crown by the treaty of Lisbon in 1688. The town
has been several times unsuccessfully besieged by the Moors&mdash;one
siege, under Mulai Ismail, lasting twenty-six years (1694-1720).
In 1810, with the consent of Spain, it was occupied by
British troops under General Sir J.F. Fraser. The town was
restored to Spain by the British at the close of the Napoleonic
Wars. As the result of the war between Spain and Morocco in
1860 the area of Spanish territory around the town was increased.
The military governor of the town also commands the troops in
the other Spanish stations on the coast of Morocco. For civil
purposes Ceuta is attached to the province of Cadiz. It is a
free port, but does little trade.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CEVA,<a name="ar39" id="ar39"></a></span> a town of Piedmont, Italy, in the province of Cuneo,
33 m. E. by rail from the town of Cuneo, 1270 ft. above sea-level.
Pop. (1901) 2703. In the middle ages it was a strong fortress
defending the confines of Piedmont towards Liguria, but the
fortifications on the rock above the town were demolished in
1800 by the French, to whom it had been ceded in 1796. Its
cheese (<i>caseus cebanus</i>) was famous in Roman times, but it does
not seem ever to have been a Roman town. It lay on the road
between Augusta Taurinorum and Vada Sabatia. A branch
railway runs from Ceva through Garessio, with its marble
quarries, to Ormea (2398 ft.), 22 m. to the south through the
upper valley of the Tanaro, which in Roman times was under
Albingaunum (Th. Mommsen in <i>Corp. Inscr. Lat.</i> v. (Berlin,
1877), p. 898). From Ormea a road runs south to (31 m.) Oneglia
on the Ligurian coast.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CÉVENNES<a name="ar40" id="ar40"></a></span> (Lat. <i>Cebenna</i> or <i>Gebenna</i>), a mountain range
of southern France, forming the southern and eastern fringe of
the central plateau and part of the watershed between the
Atlantic and Mediterranean basins. It consists of a narrow
ridge some 320 m. long, with numerous lofty plateaus and
secondary ranges branching from it. The northern division of
the range, which nowhere exceeds 3320 ft. in height, extends,
under the name of the mountains of Charolais, Beaujolais and
Lyonnais, from the Col de Longpendu (west of Chalon-sur-Saône)
in a southerly direction to the Col de Gier. The central Cévennes,
comprising the volcanic chain of Vivarais, incline south-east
and extend as far as the Lozère group. The northern portion of
this chain forms the Boutières range. Farther south it includes
the Gerbier des Joncs (5089 ft.), the Mont de Mézenc (5755 ft.),
the culminating point of the entire range, and the Tanargue
group. South of the Mont Lozère, where the Pic Finiels reaches
5584 ft., lies that portion of the range to which the name Cévennes
is most strictly applied. This region, now embraced in the
departments of Lozère and Gard, stretches south to include the
Aigoual and Espérou groups. Under various local names (the
Garrigues, the mountains of Espinouse and Lacaune) and with
numerous offshoots the range extends south-east and then east
to the Montagne Noire, which runs parallel to the Canal du
Midi and comes to an end some 25 m. east of Toulouse. In the
south the Cévennes separate the cold and barren table-lands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page778" id="page778"></a>778</span>
known as the Causses from the sunny region of Languedoc,
where the olive, vine and mulberry flourish. Northwards the
contrast between the two slopes is less striking.</p>

<p>The Cévennes proper are formed by a folded belt of Palaeozoic
rocks which lies along the south-east border of the central
plateau of France. Concealed in part by later deposits, this
ancient mountain chain extends from Castelnaudary to the
neighbourhood of Valence, where it sinks suddenly beneath the
Tertiary and recent deposits of the valley of the Rhone. It is
in the Montagne Noire rather than in the Cévennes proper that
the structure of the chain has been most fully investigated. All
the geological systems from the Cambrian to the Carboniferous
are included in the folded belt, and J. Bergeron has shown that
the gneiss and schist which form so much of the chain consist,
in part at least, of metamorphosed Cambrian beds. The direction
of the folds is about N. 60° E., and the structure is complicated
by overthrusting on an extensive scale. The overthrust came
from the south-east, and the Palaeozoic beds were crushed and
crumpled against the ancient massif of the central plateau.
The principal folding took place at the close of the Carboniferous
period, and was contemporaneous with that of the old Hercynian
chain of Belgium, &amp;c. The Permian and later beds lie unconformably
upon the denuded folds, and in the space between the
Montagne Noire and the Cévennes proper the folded belt is
buried beneath the horizontal Jurassic strata of the Causses.
Although the chain was completed in Palaeozoic times, a second
folding took place along its south-east margin at the close of
the Eocene period. The Secondary and Tertiary beds of the
Languedoc were crushed against the central plateau and were
frequently overfolded. But by this time the ancient Palaeozoic
chain had become a part of the unyielding massif, and the
folding did not extend beyond its foot.</p>

<p>As the division between the basins of the Loire and the
Garonne to the west and those of the Saône and Rhone to the
east, the Cévennes send many affluents to those rivers. In the
south the Orb, the Hérault and the Vidourle are independent
rivers flowing to the Golfe du Lion; farther north, the Gard&mdash;formed
by the union of several streams named Gardon&mdash;the
Cèze and the Ardèche flow to the Rhone. The Vivarais mountains
and the northern Cévennes approach the right banks of the
Rhone and Saône closely, and on that side send their waters by
way of short torrents to those rivers; on the west side the
streams are tributaries of the Loire, which rises at the foot of
Mont Mézenc. A short distance to the south on the same side
are the sources of the Allier and Lot. The waters of the north-western
slope of the southern Cévennes drain into the Tarn
either directly or by way of the Aveyron, which rises in the
outlying chain of the Lévezou, and, in the extreme south, the
Agout. The Tarn itself rises on the southern slope of the Mont
Lozère.</p>

<p>In the Lozère group and the southern Cévennes generally,
good pasturage is found, and huge flocks spend the summer
there. Silkworm-rearing and the cultivation of peaches, chestnuts
and other fruits are also carried on. In the Vivarais
cattle are reared, while on the slopes of the Beaujolais excellent
wines are grown.</p>

<p>The chief historical event in the history of the Cévennes is the
revolt of the Camisards in the early years of the 18th century
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Camisards</a></span>).</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CEYLON,<a name="ar41" id="ar41"></a></span> a large island and British colony in the Indian
Ocean, separated on the N.W. from India by the Gulf of Manaar
and Palk Strait. It lies between 5° 55&prime; and 9° 51&prime; N. and between
79° 41&prime; and 81° 54&prime; E. Its extreme length from north to south
is 271½ m.; its greatest width is 137½ m.; and its area amounts
to 25,481 sq. m., or about five-sixths of that of Ireland. In its
general outline the island resembles a pear, the apex of which
points towards the north.</p>

<p>The coast is beset on the N.W. with numberless sandbanks,
rocks and shoals, and may be said to be almost connected with
India by the island of Rameswaram and Adam&rsquo;s
Bridge, a succession of bold rocks reaching almost
<span class="sidenote">Coast.</span>
across the gulf at its narrowest point. Between the island and
the opposite coast there exist two open channels of varying
depth and width, beset by rocks and shoals. One of these, the
Manaar Passage, is only navigable by very small craft. The
other, called the Paumben Passage, lying between Rameswaram
and the mainland, has been deepened at considerable outlay,
and is used by large vessels in passing from the Malabar to the
Coromandel coast, which were formerly compelled in doing so
to make the circuit of the island. The west and south coasts,
which are uniformly low, are fringed their entire length by coco-nut
trees, which grow to the water&rsquo;s edge in great luxuriance,
and give the island a most picturesque appearance. Along these
shores there are numerous inlets and backwaters of the sea, some
of which are available as harbours for small native craft. The
east coast from Point de Galle to Trincomalee is of an entirely
opposite character, wanting the ample vegetation of the other,
and being at the same time of a bold precipitous character. The
largest ships may freely approach this side of the island, provided
they take care to avoid a few dangerous rocks, whose localities,
however, are well known to navigators.</p>

<p>Seen from a distance at sea this &ldquo;utmost Indian isle&rdquo; of
the old geographers wears a truly beautiful appearance. The
remarkable elevation known as &ldquo;Adam&rsquo;s Peak,&rdquo; the most
prominent, though not the loftiest, of the hilly ranges of the
interior, towers like a mountain monarch amongst an assemblage
of picturesque hills, and is a sure landmark for the navigator
when as yet the Colombo lighthouse is hidden from sight amid
the green groves of palms that seem to be springing from the
waters of the ocean. The low coast-line encircles the mountain
zone of the interior on the east, south and west, forming a belt
which extends inland to a varying distance of from 30 to 80 m.;
but on the north the whole breadth of the island from Kalpitiya
to Batticaloa is an almost unbroken plain, containing magnificent
forests of great extent.</p>

<p>The mountain zone is towards the south of the island, and
covers an area of about 4212 sq. m. The uplifting force seems
to have been exerted from south-west to north-east, and
although there is much confusion in many of the intersecting
<span class="sidenote">Mountains.</span>
ridges, and spurs of great size and extent are sent
off in many directions, the lower ranges manifest a remarkable
tendency to run in parallel ridges in a direction from south-east to
north-west. Towards the north the offsets of the mountain system
radiate to short distances and speedily sink to the level of the
plain. Detached hills are rare; the most celebrated of these are
Mihintale (anc. <i>Missïaka</i>), which overlooks the sacred city of
Anuradhapura, and Sigiri. The latter is the only example in
Ceylon of those solitary acclivities which form so remarkable a
feature in the tableland of the Deccan&mdash;which, starting abruptly
from the plain, with scarped and perpendicular sides, are frequently
converted into strongholds accessible only by precipitous pathways
or by steps hewn in the solid rock.</p>

<p>For a long period Adam&rsquo;s Peak was supposed to be the highest
mountain in Ceylon, but actual survey makes it only 7353 ft.
above sea-level. This elevation is chiefly remarkable as the
resort of pilgrims from all parts of the East. The hollow in the
lofty rock that crowns the summit is said by the Brahmans to
be the footstep of Siva, by the Buddhists of Buddha, by the
Mahommedans of Adam, whilst the Portuguese Christians were
divided between the conflicting claims of St Thomas and the
eunuch of Candace, queen of Ethiopia. The footstep is covered
by a handsome roof, and is guarded by the priests of a rich
monastery half-way up the mountain, who maintain a shrine on
the summit of the peak. The highest mountains in Ceylon are
Pidurutalagala, 8296 ft. in altitude; Kirigalpota, 7836 ft.; and
Totapelakanda, 7746 ft.</p>

<p>The summits of the highest ridges are clothed with verdure,
and along their base, in the beautiful valleys which intersect
them in every direction, the slopes were formerly covered with
forests of gigantic and valuable trees, which, however, have
disappeared under the axe of the planter, who felled and burnt
the timber on all the finest slopes at an elevation of 2000 to 4500
ft., and converted the hillsides into highly cultivated coffee and
afterwards tea estates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page779" id="page779"></a>779</span></p>

<p>The plain of Nuwara Eliya, the sanatorium of the island, is at
an elevation of 6200 ft., and possesses many of the attributes of
an alpine country. The climate of the Horton plains, at an
elevation of 7000 ft., is still finer than that of Nuwara Eliya, but
they are difficult of access, and are but little known to Europeans.
The town of Kandy, in the Central Province, formerly the capital
of the native sovereigns of the interior, is situated 1727 ft. above
sea-level.</p>

<p>The island, though completely within the influence of oceanic
evaporation, and possessing an elevated tableland of considerable
extent, does not boast of any rivers of great volume.
The rains which usher in each monsoon or change of
<span class="sidenote">Rivers.</span>
season are indeed heavy, and during their fall swell the streams
to torrents and impetuous rivers. But when these cease the water-courses
fall back to their original state, and there are few of the
rivers which cannot generally be passed on horseback. The
largest river, the Mahaweliganga, has a course of 206 m., draining
about one-sixth of the area of the island before it reaches the
sea at Trincomalee on the east coast. There are twelve other
considerable rivers, running to the west, east and south, but
none of these exceeds 90 m. in length. The rivers are not
favourable for navigation, except near the sea, where they
expand into backwaters, which were used by the Dutch for the
construction of their system of canals all round the western and
southern coasts. Steamers ply between Colombo and Negombo
along this narrow canal and lake. A similar service on the
Kaluganga did not prove a success. There are no inland lakes
except the remains of magnificent artificial lakes in the north
and east of the island, and the backwaters on the coast. The
lakes which add to the beauty of Colombo, Kandy, Lake Gregory,
Nuwara Eliya and Kurunegala are artificial or partly so. Giant&rsquo;s
Tank is said to have an area of 6380 acres, and Minneri and
Kalawewa each exceed 4000 acres.</p>

<p>The magnificent basin of Trincomalee, situated on the east
coast of Ceylon, is perhaps unsurpassed in extent, security and
beauty by any haven in the world. The admiralty had a dockyard
here which was closed in 1905.</p>

<p><i>Geology.</i>&mdash;Ceylon may be said to have been for ages slowly
rising from the sea, as appears from the terraces abounding in
marine shells, which occur in situations far above high-water
mark, and at some miles distance from the sea. A great portion
of the north of the island may be regarded as the joint production
of the coral polyps and the currents, which for the greater part
of the year set impetuously towards the south; coming laden
with alluvial matter collected along the coast of Coromandel,
and meeting with obstacles south of Point Calimere, they have
deposited their burdens on the coral reefs round Point Pedro;
and these, raised above the sea-level and covered deeply by sand
drifts, have formed the peninsula of Jaffna, and the plains that
trend westward till they unite with the narrow causeway of
Adam&rsquo;s Bridge. Tertiary rocks are almost unknown. The great
geological feature of the island is the profusion of gneiss, overlaid
in many places in the interior by extensive beds of dolomitic
limestone. This formation appears to be of great thickness;
and when, as is not often the case, the under-surface of
the gneiss series is exposed, it is invariably found resting on
granite. Veins of pure quartz and felspar of considerable extent
have been frequently met with in the gneiss; while in the
elevated lands of the interior in the Galle districts may be seen
copious deposits of disintegrated felspar, or <i>kaolin</i>, commonly
known as porcelain clay. At various elevations the gneiss may
be found intersected by veins of trap rock, upheaved whilst in a
state of fusion subsequent to the consolidation of the former.
In some localities on the seashore these veins assume the
character of pitch-stone porphyry highly impregnated with
iron. Hornblende and primitive greenstone are found in the
vicinity of Adam&rsquo;s Peak and in the Pussellava district. Laterite,
known in Ceylon as <i>kabuk</i>, a product of disintegrated gneiss,
exists in vast quantities in many parts, and is quarried for
building purposes.</p>

<p><i>Climate.</i>&mdash;The seasons in Ceylon differ very slightly from
those prevailing along the coasts of the Indian peninsula. The
two distinctive monsoons of the year are called, from the winds
which accompany them, the south-west and the north-east.
The former is very regular in its approach, and may be looked
for along the south-west coast between the 10th and 20th of
May; the latter reaches the north-east coast between the end
of October and the middle of November. There is a striking
contrast in the influence which the south-west monsoon exerts
on the one side of the island and on the other. The clouds are
driven against the lofty mountains that overhang the western
and southern coasts, and their condensed vapours descend there
in copious showers. But the rains do not reach the opposite
side of the island: while the south-west is deluged, the east and
north are sometimes exhausted with dryness; and it not unfrequently
happens that different sides of the same mountain
present at the same moment the opposite extreme of droughts
and moisture. The influence of the north-east monsoon is more
general. The mountains which face the north-east are lower
and more remote from the sea than those on the south-west;
the clouds are carried farther inland, and it rains simultaneously
on both sides of the island.</p>

<p>The length of the day, owing to the proximity of the island
to the equator, does not vary more than an hour at any season.
The mean time of the rising of the sun&rsquo;s centre at Colombo on

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Flora</i>.&mdash;The characteristics of the low-growing plants of Ceylon
approach nearly to those of the coasts of southern India. The
<i>Rhizophoreae</i> are numerous along the low muddy shores of salt lakes
and stagnant pools; and the acacias are equally abundant. The
list comprises <i>Aegiceras fragrans</i>, <i>Epithinia malayana</i>, <i>Thespesia
populnea</i>, <i>Feronia elephantum</i>, <i>Salvadora persica</i> (the true mustard
tree of Scripture), <i>Eugenia bracteata</i>, <i>Elaeodendron Roxburghii</i>, <i>Cassia
Fistula</i>, <i>Cassia Roxburghii</i>, &amp;c. The herbaceous plants of the low
country belong mostly to the natural orders <i>Compositae</i>, <i>Leguminosae</i>,
<i>Rubiaceae</i>, <i>Scrophulariaceae</i> and <i>Euphorbiaceae</i>.</p>

<p>Leaving the plains of the maritime country and ascending a
height of 4000 ft. in the central districts, we find both herbage and
trees assume an altered character. The foliage of the latter is larger
and deeper coloured, and they attain a height unknown in the hot
low country. The herbaceous vegetation is there made up of ferns,
<i>Cyrtandreae</i>, <i>Compositae</i>, <i>Scitamineae</i> and <i>Urticaceae</i>. The dense
masses of lofty forest at that altitude are interspersed with large
open tracts of coarse wiry grass, called by the natives <i>patanas</i>, and
of value to them as affording pasturage for their cattle.</p>

<p>Between the altitudes of 4000 and 8000 ft., many plants are to
be met with partaking of European forms, yet blended with tropical
characteristics. The guelder rose, St John&rsquo;s wort, the <i>Nepenthes
distillatoria</i> or pitcher plant, violets, geraniums, buttercups, sundews,
ladies&rsquo; mantles and campanulas thrive by the side of <i>Magnoliaceae</i>,
<i>Ranunculaceae</i>, <i>Elaeocarpeae</i>, &amp;c. The most beautiful
flowering shrub of this truly alpine region is the rhododendron, which
in many instances grows to the height of 70 ft. It is met with in
great abundance in the moist plains of the elevated land above
Nuwara Eliya, flowering abundantly in June and July. There are
two distinct varieties, one similar to the Nilgiri plant, having its
leaves broad and cordate, and of a rusty colour on the under side;
the other, peculiar to Ceylon, is found only in forests at the loftiest
elevations; it has narrow rounded leaves, silvery on the under side,
and grows to enormous heights, frequently measuring 3 ft. round the
stem. At these altitudes English flowers, herbs and vegetables have
been cultivated with perfect success, as also wheat, oats and barley.
English fruit-trees grow, but rarely bear. Grapes are grown successfully
in the north of the island. The vines were introduced by the
Dutch, who overcame the difficulty of perpetual summer by exposing
the roots, and thus giving the plants an artificial winter.</p>

<p>The timber trees indigenous to Ceylon are met with at every
altitude from the sea-beach to the loftiest mountain peak. They
vary much in their hardiness and durability, from the common
cashew-nut tree, which when felled decays in a month, to the ebony
and satinwood, which for many years resist the attacks of insects
and climate. Many of the woods are valuable for furniture, and
house and shipbuilding, and are capable of standing long exposure
to weather. The most beautiful woods adapted to furniture work
are the calamander, ebony, flowered satinwood, tamarind, nedun,
dell, kadomberiya, kitul, coco-nut, &amp;c.; the sack-yielding tree
(<i>Antiaris saccidora</i>), for a long time confounded with the far-famed
upas tree of Java (<i>Antiaris toxicaria</i>), grows in the Kurunegala
district of the island. The <i>Cocos nucifera</i>, or coco-nut palm, is a
native of the island, and may justly be considered the most valuable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page780" id="page780"></a>780</span>
of its trees. It grows in vast abundance alone the entire sea-coast
of the west and south sides of the island, and furnishes almost all
that a Sinhalese villager requires. Its fruit, when green, supplies food
and drink; when ripe, it yields oil. The juice of the unopened
flower gives him toddy and arrack. The fibrous casing of the fruit
when woven makes him ropes, nets, matting. The nut-shells form
drinking-vessels, spoons, &amp;c. The plaited leaves serve as plates and
dishes, and as thatch for his cottage. The dried leaves are used as
torches, the large leaf-stalks as garden fences. The trunk of the tree
sawn up is employed for every possible purpose, from knife-handles
to door-posts; hollowed out it forms a canoe or a coffin. There are
four kinds of this palm&mdash;the common, the king, the dwarf and the
Maldive. The Palmyra and Areca palms grow luxuriantly and
abundantly, the former in the northern, the latter in the western
and central districts. The one is valuable chiefly for its timber, of
which large quantities are exported to the Indian coasts; the other
supplies the betel-nut in common use amongst natives of the eastern
tropics as a masticatory. The export trade in the latter to India and
eastern ports is very considerable. Next in importance to the coco-nut
palm among the indigenous products of Ceylon is the cinnamon
plant, yielding the well-known spice of that name.</p>

<p><i>Fauna</i>.&mdash;Foremost among the animals of Ceylon is the elephant,
which, though far inferior to those of Africa and the Indian continent,
is nevertheless of considerable value when tamed, on account of its
strength, sagacity and docility. They are to be met with in greater
or less numbers throughout most unfrequented parts of the interior.
Occasionally they make inroads in herds upon the cultivated grounds
and plantations, committing great damage. In order to protect
these lands, and at the same time keep up the government stud of
draught elephants, &ldquo;kraals&rdquo; or traps on a large scale are erected
in the forests, into which the wild herds are driven; and once secured
they are soon tamed and fit for service. The oxen are of small size,
but hardy, and capable of drawing heavy loads. Buffaloes exist in
great numbers throughout the interior, where they are employed
in a half-tame state for ploughing rice-fields and treading out the
corn. They feed upon any coarse grass, and can therefore be maintained
on the village pasture-lands where oxen would not find
support. Of deer, Ceylon possesses the spotted kind (<i>Axis maculata</i>),
the muntjac (<i>Stylocerus muntjac</i>), a red deer (the Sambur of India),
popularly called the Ceylon elk (<i>Musa Aristotelis</i>), and the small
musk (<i>Moschus minima</i>). There are five species of monkeys, one
the small rilawa (<i>Macacus pileatus</i>), and four known in Ceylon by
the name of &ldquo;wandaru&rdquo; (<i>Presbytes ursinus</i>, <i>P. Thersites</i>, <i>P. cephalopterus</i>,
<i>P. Priamus</i>), and the small quadrumanous animal, the loris
(<i>Loris gracilis</i>), known as the &ldquo;Ceylon sloth.&rdquo; Of the Cheiroptera
sixteen species have been identified; amongst them is the rousette
or flying fox (<i>Pteropus Edwardsii</i>). Of the Carnivora the only one
dangerous to man is the small black bear (<i>Prochilus labiatus</i>). The
tiger is not known in Ceylon, but the true panther (<i>Felis pardus</i>) is
common, as is the jackal (<i>Canis aureus</i>) and the mongoose or ichneumon
(<i>Herpestes vitticollis</i>). Rats are numerous, as are the
squirrel and the porcupine, and the pig-rat or bandicoot (<i>Mus bandicota</i>),
while the scaly ant-eater (<i>Manis pentedactyla</i>), locally known
by the Malay name of pangolin, is occasionally found. The dugong
(<i>Halicore dugong</i>), is frequently seen on various points of the coast.
A game preservation society and the judicious action of government
have done much to prevent the wanton destruction of Ceylon deer,
elephants, &amp;c., by establishing a close season. It is estimated that
there must be 5000 wild elephants in the Ceylon forests. A licence
to shoot or capture and an export royalty are now levied by government.</p>

<p>Captain V. Legge includes 371 species of birds in Ceylon, and many
of them have splendid plumage, but in this respect they are surpassed
by the birds of South America and Northern India. The eagles are
small and rare, but hawks and owls are numerous; among the latter
is a remarkable brown species, the cry of which has earned for it
the name of the &ldquo;devil-bird.&rdquo; The esculent swift, which furnishes
in its edible nest the celebrated Chinese dainty, builds in caves in
Ceylon. Crows of various species are numerous, and in the wilder
parts pea-fowl are abundant. There are also to be mentioned king-fishers,
sun-birds, several beautiful fly-catchers and snatchers, the
golden oriole, parroquets and numerous pigeons, of which there are
at least a dozen species. The Ceylon jungle-fowl (<i>Gallus Lafayetti</i>)
is distinct from the Indian species. Ceylon is singularly rich in
wading and water birds&mdash;ibises, storks, egrets, spoonbills and herons
being frequently seen on the wet sands, while flamingoes line the
beach in long files, and on the deeper waters inland are found teal
and a countless variety of ducks and smaller fowl. Of the birds
familiar to European sportsmen there are partridge, quail and snipe
in abundance, and the woodcock has been seen.</p>

<p>The poisonous snakes of Ceylon are not numerous. Four species
have been enumerated&mdash;the ticpolonga (<i>Daboia elegans</i>), the cobra
di capello (<i>Naja tripudians</i>), the carawilla (<i>Trigonocephalus hypnale</i>),
and the <i>Trigonocephalus nigromarginatus</i>, which is so rare that it has
no popular name. The largest snake in Ceylon is the &ldquo;boa,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;anaconda&rdquo; of Eastern story (<i>Python reticulatus</i>); it is from
20 to 30 ft. in length, and preys on hog-deer and other smaller
animals. Crocodiles infest the rivers and estuaries, and the large
fresh-water reservoirs which supply the rice-fields; there are two
species (<i>C. biporcatus</i> and <i>C. palustris</i>). Of lizards the most noteworthy
are the iguana, several bloodsuckers, the chameleon and the
familiar geckoes, which are furnished with pads to each toe, by
which they are enabled to ascend perpendicular walls and adhere to
glass and ceilings.</p>

<p>Insects exist in great numbers. The leaf and stick insects are of
great variety and beauty. Ceylon has four species of the ant-lion,
renowned for the predaceous ingenuity of its larvae; and the white
ants or termites, the ravages of which are most destructive, are at
once ubiquitous and innumerable in every place where the climate
is not too chilly or the soil too sandy for them to construct their
domed dwellings. They make their way through walls and floors,
and in a few hours destroy every vegetable substance within their
reach. Of all the insect pests that beset an unseasoned European
the most annoying are the mosquitoes. Ticks are also an intolerable
nuisance; they are exceedingly minute, and burrow under the skin.
In the lower ranges of the hill country land leeches are found in
tormenting profusion. But insects and reptiles do not trouble European
residents so much as in early years&mdash;at any rate in the towns,
while in the higher planting districts there is almost complete
exemption from their unwelcome attentions. Bungalows are more
carefully built to resist white ants, drainage and cleanliness prevent
mosquitoes and ticks from multiplying, while snakes and leeches
avoid cultivated, occupied ground.</p>

<p>Of the fish in ordinary use for the table the finest is the seir, a
species of scomber (<i>Cybium guttatum</i>). Mackerel, dories, carp,
whitings, mullet (red and striped), soles and sardines are abundant.
Sharks appear on all parts of the coast, and the huge saw fish (<i>Pristis
antiquorum</i>) infests the eastern coast of the island, where it attains
a length of 12 to 15 ft. There are also several fishes remarkable for
the brilliancy of their colouring; <i>e.g.</i> the Red Sea perch (<i>Holocentrum
rubrum</i>), of the deepest scarlet, and the great fire fish (<i>Scorpaena
miles</i>), of a brilliant red. Some are purple, others yellow, and numbers
with scales of a lustrous green are called &ldquo;parrots&rdquo; by the natives;
of these one (<i>Sparus Hardwickii</i>) is called the &ldquo;flower parrot,&rdquo; from
its exquisite colouring&mdash;irregular bands of blue, crimson and purple,
green, yellow and grey, crossed by perpendicular stripes of black.
The pearl fishery, as indicated below, is of great importance.</p>

<p><i>Population</i>.&mdash;The total population of Ceylon in 1901, inclusive
of military, shipping and 4914 prisoners of war, was 3,578,333,
showing an increase of 18.8% in the decade. The population of
Colombo was 158,228.</p>

</table>

<p class="noind">Altogether there are representatives of some seventy races in Ceylon.
The Veddahs, who run wild in the woods, are the aborigines of the
island.</p>

<p><i>Language</i>.&mdash;The language of nearly 70% of the population is
Sinhalese, which is nearly allied to Pali (<i>q.v.</i>); of the remaining
30%, with the exception of Europeans, the language is Tamil. A
corrupt form of Portuguese is spoken by some natives of European
descent. The Veddahs, a small forest tribe, speak a distinct language,
and the Rodiyas, an outcast tribe, possess a large vocabulary of their
own. The Sinhalese possess several original poems of some merit,
and an extensive and most interesting series of native chronicles, but
their most valuable literature is written in Pali, though the greater
portion of it has been translated into Sinhalese, and is best known
to the people through these Sinhalese translations.</p>

<p><i>Religion</i>.&mdash;The principal religions may be distributed as follows:&mdash;Christians,
349,239; Buddhists, 2,141,404; Hindus, 826,826;
Mahommedans, 246,118. Of the Christians, 287,419 are Roman
Catholics, and 61,820 are Protestants of various denominations;
and of these Christians 319,001 are natives, and 30,238 Europeans.
The Mahommedans are the descendants of Arabs (locally termed
Moormen) and the Malays. The Tamils, both the inhabitants of the
island and the immigrants from India, are Hindus, with the exception
of 93,000 Christians. The Sinhalese, numbering 70% of the whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page781" id="page781"></a>781</span>
population, are, with the exception of 180,000 Christians, Buddhists.
Ceylon may properly be called a Buddhist country, and it is here that
Buddhism is found almost in its pristine purity. Ceylon was converted
to Buddhism in the 3rd century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> by the great Augustine
of Buddhism, Mahinda, son of the Indian king Asoka; and the extensive
ruins throughout Ceylon, especially in the ancient cities of
Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa, bear witness to the sacrifices
which kings and people joined in making to create lasting monuments
of their faith. The Buddhist temples in the Kandyan country
possess valuable lands, the greater portion of which is held by
hereditary tenants on the tenure of service. These lands were given
out with much care to provide for all that was necessary to maintain
the temple and its connected monastery. Some tenants had to do
the blacksmiths&rsquo; work, others the carpenters&rsquo;, while another set of
tenants had to cultivate the land reserved for supplying the monastery;
others again had to attend at the festivals, and prepare
decorations, and carry lamps and banners. In course of time
difficulties arose; the English courts were averse to a system under
which the rent of lands was paid by hereditary service, and a commission
was issued by Sir Hercules Robinson (afterwards Lord
Rosmead) when governor, to deal with the whole question, to define
the services and to enable the tenants to commute these for a money
payment. The result of the inquiry was to show that the services,
except in a few instances, were not onerous, and that almost without
an exception the tenants were willing to continue the system. The
anomaly of an ecclesiastical establishment of Anglican and Presbyterian
chaplains with a bishop of Colombo paid out of the general
revenues has now been abolished in Ceylon, and only the bishop and
two or three incumbents remain on the list for life, or till they retire
on pension.</p>

<p><i>Education</i>.&mdash;There has been a great advance in public instruction
since 1875, through the multiplication of vernacular, Anglo-vernacular
and English schools by government, by the different
Christian missions and by the Buddhists and Hindus who have
come forward to claim the government grant. The government has
also started a technical college, and an agricultural school has been
reorganized. An agricultural department, recommended by a
commission, should profit by the services of the entomologist,
mycologist and chemical analyst added by the governor to the staff
of the royal botanic gardens at Peradeniya. There are industrial
and reformatory schools, which are partially supported by government.
In spite of the great advance that has been made, however,
at the census of 1901 no fewer than 2,790,235 of the total population
were entered as unable to read or write their own tongue. Of this
number 1,553,078 were females, showing a very unsatisfactory state
of things.</p>

<p><i>Agriculture.</i>&mdash;The natural soils of Ceylon are composed of quartzose
gravel, felspathic clay and sand often of a pure white, blended with
or overlaid by brown and red loams, resulting; from the
decay of vegetable matter, or the disintegration of the
<span class="sidenote">Soil.</span>
gneiss and hornblende formations. The whole of the great northern
extremity of the island consists of a sandy and calcareous admixture,
made to yield productive crops of grain, tobacco, cotton and vegetables
by the careful industry of the Tamil population, who spare
no pains in irrigating and manuring their lands. Between the
northern districts and the elevated mountain ranges which overlook
the Bintenne and Uva countries are extensive plains of alluvial soil
washed down from the table-lands above, where once a teeming population
produced large quantities of grain. The remains of ancient
works of irrigation bear testimony to the bygone agriculture of these
extensive regions now covered by swamps or dense jungle.</p>

<p>The general character of the soil in the maritime provinces to the
east, south and west is sandy. Large tracts of quartzose sand spread
along the whole line of sea-coast, some of which, of a pure white, and
very deficient in vegetable matter, is admirably adapted to the
growth of the cinnamon plant. In the light sandy districts where
the soil is perfectly free, and contains a portion of vegetable and
mineral loam, the coco-nut palm flourishes in great luxuriance.
This is the case along the entire coast line from Kalpitiya to Point
de Galle, and farther eastward and northward to Matara, stretching
to a distance inland varying from 100 yds. to 3 m. From this light
sandy belt as far as the mountain-zone of the Kandyan country the
land is mainly composed of low hilly undulations of sandstone and
ferruginous clay, incapable of almost any cultivation, but intersected
in every direction with extensive valleys and wide plains of a more
generous soil, not highly fertile, but still capable, with a little
industry, of yielding ample crops of rice.</p>

<p>The soil of the central province, although frequently containing
great quantities of quartzose sand and ferruginous clay, is in many
of the more elevated districts of a fine loamy character. Sand
sufficiently vegetable and light for rice culture may be seen at all
elevations in the hill districts; but the fine chocolate and brown
loams overlying gneiss or limestone formations, so admirably adapted
for coffee cultivation, are only to be found on the steep sides or along
the base of mountain ranges at an elevation varying from 2000 to
4000 ft. Such land, well-timbered, contains in its elements the decomposed
particles of the rocks above, blended with the decayed vegetable
matter of forests that have for centuries scattered beneath them
the germs of fertility. The quantity of really rich coffee land in these
districts is but small as compared with the extent of country&mdash;vast
tracts of open valleys consisting of an indifferent yellow tenacious
soil interspersed with many low ranges of quartz rock, but tea is a
much hardier plant than coffee, and grows on poorer soil.</p>

<p><i>Irrigation</i>.&mdash;The native rulers covered the whole face of the
country with a network of irrigation reservoirs, by which Ceylon
was enabled in ancient times to be the great granary of southern
Asia. Wars, and the want of a strong hand to guide the agriculture
of the country, led to the decay of these ancient works, and large
tracts of land, which were formerly highly productive, became
swampy wastes or dense forests. The remains of some of the larger
irrigation works are amongst the most interesting of the memorials
of Ceylon&rsquo;s former greatness. Some of the artificial lakes were of
great size. Minneri, formed by damming across the valleys between
the low hills which surround it with an embankment 60 ft. wide at
the top, is at this day 20 m. in circumference. It has recently been
restored by government, and is capable of irrigating 15,000 acres;
while the Giant&rsquo;s Tank, which has also been restored, irrigates
20,000 acres. Another lake, with an embankment several miles in
length, the Kalawewa, was formed by damming back the waters of
the Kalaoya, but they have forced their way through the embankment,
and in the ancient bed of the lake, or tank, are now many small
villages. In connexion with these large tanks were numerous canals
and channels for supplying smaller tanks, or for irrigating large
tracts of fields. Throughout the district of Nuwarakalawiya every
village has its tank. The embankments have been formed with great
skill, and advantage has been taken to the utmost of the slightest
fall in the land; but they in common with the larger works had been
allowed to fall into decay, and were being brought to destruction
by the evil practice of cutting them every year to irrigate the fields.
The work of restoring these embankments was undertaken by the
government, and 100 village tanks were repaired every year, besides
eighteen larger works. In 1900 a sum of five million rupees was set
apart for these larger undertakings.</p>

<p><i>Cultivation and Products.</i>&mdash;The area of uncultivated land is little
over 3½ million acres, whereas fully four times that amount is capable
of cultivation. A great deal is waste, besides lagoons, tanks, backwaters,
&amp;c. Thick forest land does not cover more than 5000 sq. m.
Scrub, or chena, and patana grass cover a very great area. Tea,
cacao, cardamoms, cinchona, coffee and indiarubber are the products
cultivated by European and an increasing number of native planters
in the hill country and part of the low country of Ceylon. A great
change has been effected in the appearance of the country by the
introduction of the tea plant in place of the coffee plant, after the
total failure of the latter owing to disease. For some time coffee
had been the most important crop. In the old days it grew wild like
cinnamon, and was exported so far back as the time of the Portuguese,
but was lightly esteemed as an article of European commerce,
as the berry was gathered unripe, was imperfectly cured and had
little flavour. In 1824 the governor, Sir E. Barnes, introduced coffee
cultivation on the West Indian plan; in 1834 the falling off of other
sources of supply drew general attention to Ceylon, and by 1841
the Ceylon output had become considerable, and grew steadily (with
an interval in 1847 due to a commercial crisis) till 1877 when 272,000
acres were under coffee cultivation, the total export amounting to
103,000,000 &#8468; Then owing to disease came a crisis, and a rapid
decline, and now only a few thousand acres are left. On the failure
of the coffee crops planters began extensively to grow the tea plant,
which had already been known in the island for several years. By
1882 over 20,000 acres had been planted with tea, but the export
that year was under 700,000 &#8468; Five years later the area planted
was 170,000 acres, while the export had risen to nearly 14,000,000 &#8468;
By 1892 there were 262,000 acres covered with tea, and 71,000,000 &#8468;
were that year exported. In 1897, 350,000 acres were planted, and
the export was 116,000,000 &#8468; By the beginning of the 20th century,
the total area cultivated with tea was not under 390,000 acres, while
the estimate of shipments was put at 146,000,000 &#8468; annually.
Nearly every plantation has its factory, with the machinery necessary
to prepare the leaf as brought in from the bushes until it becomes
the tea of commerce. The total amount of capital now invested in
the tea industry in Ceylon cannot be less than £10,000,000. The
tea-planting industry more than anything else has raised Ceylon
from the depressed state to which it fell in 1882.</p>

<p>Before tea was proved a success, however, <i>cinchona</i> cultivation
was found a useful bridge from coffee to the Ceylon planter, who,
however, grew it so freely that in one year 15,000,000 &#8468; bark was
shipped, bringing the price of quinine down from 16s. to 1s. 6d. an
ounce.</p>

<p>In a few places, where the rainfall is abundant, rice cultivation
is allowed to depend on the natural supply of water, but in most
parts the cultivation is not attempted unless there is secured beforehand
a certain and sufficient supply, by means of canals or reservoirs.
In the hill country every valley and open plain capable of tillage is
made to yield its crops of grain, and the steep sides of the hills are
cut into terraces, on which are seen waving patches of green rice
watered by mountain streams, which are conducted by means of
channels ingeniously carried round the spurs of the hills and along
the face of acclivities, by earthen water-courses and bamboo aqueducts,
so as to fertilize the fields below. These works bear witness to
the patience, industry and skill of the Kandyan villagers. In the
low country to the north and east and north-west of the hills,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page782" id="page782"></a>782</span>
irrigation works of a more expensive kind are necessary. In January
1892, the immemorial rent or tax on fields of <i>paddy</i> (rice in the husk)
was removed, but not the customs duty on imported rice. But even
with the advantage of protection to the extent of 10% in the local
markets, there has been no extension of paddy cultivation; on the
contrary, the import of grain from India has grown larger year by
year. Through the multiplication of irrigation works and the
northern railway, rice culture may be sufficiently extended to save
some of the large imports (8,000,000 to 9,000,000 bushels annually)
now required from India.</p>

<p>Tobacco is extensively cultivated in various parts of the island,
and the growth of particular places, such as Dumbara and Uva,
is much prized for local consumption. The tobacco of export is
grown in the peninsula of Jaffna. The exports of this article in 1850
were 22,176 cwts., valued at £20,698. The cultivation of the plant
has not greatly increased of recent years, and is almost entirely in
the hands of natives in the northern and parts of the central Province.</p>

<p>Ceylon has been celebrated since the middle of the 14th century
for its cinnamon, and during the period of the Dutch occupation this
spice was the principal article of commerce; under their rule and
up to 1832 its cultivation was a government monopoly. With the
abolition of the monopoly the quantity exported increased, but the
value declined.</p>

<p>Unlike the coffee plant, the hardy tea plant grows from sea-level
to 7000 ft. altitude; but crown forest-lands above 5000 ft. are no
longer sold, so that a very large area on the highest mountain ranges
and plateaus is still under forest. Moreover, on the tea plantations
arboriculture is attended to in a way unknown in 1875; the Australian
eucalypts, acacias and grevilleas, Indian and Japanese
conifers, and other trees of different lands, are now freely planted for
ornament, for protection from wind, for firewood or for timber.
A great advance has been made at Hakgalla and Nuwara Eliya, in
Upper Uva, and other high districts, in naturalizing English fruits
and vegetables. The calamander tree is nearly extinct, and ebony
and other fine cabinet woods are getting scarce; but the conservation
of forests after the Indian system has been taken in hand
under a director and trained officers, and much good has been done.
The cinnamon tree (wild in the jungles, cultivated as a shrub in
plantations) is almost the only one yielding a trade product which is
indigenous to the island. The coco-nut and nearly all other palms
have been introduced.</p>

<p>Among other agricultural products mention must be made of
<i>cacao</i>, the growth and export of which have steadily extended since
coffee failed. Important also is the spice or aromatic product of
cardamoms.</p>

<p>The culture of <i>indiarubber</i> was begun on low-country plantations,
and Ceylon rubber is of the best quality in the market. The area
of cultivation of the coco-nut palm has been greatly extended
since 1875 by natives as well as by Europeans. The products of this
palm that are exported, apart from those so extensively used in the
island itself, exceed in a good year £1,000,000 sterling in value.
Viticulture and cotton cultivation, as well as tobacco growing, are
being developed along the course of the new northern railway.</p>

<p>Taking the trade in the products mentioned as a whole, no country
can compete with the United Kingdom as a customer of Ceylon.
But there is a considerable trade in nearly all products with Germany
and America; in cardamoms with India; in cinnamon with Spain,
Italy, Belgium, Australia, Austria and France; and in one or other
of the products of the coco-nut palm (coco-nuts, coco-nut oil,
copra, desiccated coco-nut, poonac, coir) with Belgium, Russia,
France, Austria, Australia and Holland.</p>

<p><i>Pearl Fishery.</i>&mdash;Pearl oysters are found in the Tambalagam bay,
near Trincomalee, but the great banks on which these oysters are
usually found lie near Arippu, off the northern part of the west coast
of Ceylon, at a distance of from 16 to 20 m. from the shore. They
extend for many miles north and south, varying considerably in their
size and productiveness. It is generally believed that the oyster
arrives at maturity in its seventh year, that the pearl is then of full
size and perfect lustre, and that if the oyster be not then secured it
will shortly die, and the pearl be lost. It is certain that from some
unexplained cause the oysters disappear from their known beds for
years together. The Dutch had no fishery from 1732 to 1746, and
it failed them again for twenty-seven years from 1768 to 1796.
The fishery was again interrupted between 1820 and 1828, also from
1833 to 1854, from 1864 to 1873, and again from 1892 to 1900. The
fishery of 1903 was the first since 1891, and produced a revenue of
Rs. 829,348, being the third largest on record. In 1797 and 1798
the government sold the privilege of fishing the oyster-beds for
£123,982 and £142,780 respectively. From that time the fishery
was conducted by the government itself until 1906, when it was
leased to the Ceylon Pearl Fisheries Company for twenty years at
a rent of £20,000 a year. Professor Herdman, F.R.S., was appointed
to inquire and report on the conservation and cultivation of the
Ceylon pearl-oyster, and visited Ceylon in January 1902. In
consequence of his report, a marine laboratory for the culture of the
pearl oysters was established in Galle harbour under the care of
Mr Hornell.</p>

<p><i>Mineral Industries.</i>&mdash;Commercially there are two established
mineral industries:&mdash;(1) that of digging for precious stones; and
(2) the much more important industry of digging for plumbago or
graphite, the one mineral of commercial importance found. Further
developments may result in the shipment of the exceptionally pure
iron ore found in different parts of Ceylon, though still no coal has
been found to be utilized with it. Several places, too&mdash;Ruanwella,
Rangalla, Rangbodde, &amp;c.&mdash;indicate where gold was found in the
time of the Kandyan kings; and geologists might possibly indicate
a paying quartz reef, as in Mysore. Owing to the greatly increased
demand in Europe and America, plumbago in 1899 more than doubled
in price, rising from £40 to £80, and even £100 a ton for the
finest. Latterly there has been a considerable fall, but the permanent
demand is likely to continue keen in consequence mainly of the Ceylon
kind being the best for making crucibles. The trade with Great
Britain and the United States has slightly decreased, but there has
been a rapid expansion in the exports to Belgium and Holland,
Russia, Japan and Victoria; and the industry seems to be established
on a sound basis. One consequence of its development has been
to bring European and American capitalists and Cornish and Italian
miners into a field hitherto almost entirely worked by Sinhalese.
Though some of the mines were carried to a depth of 1000 ft., the
work was generally very primitive in character, and Western
methods of working are sure to lead to greater safety and economy.
Besides a royalty or customs duty of 5 rupees (about 6s. 8d.) per
ton on all plumbago exported, the government issue licenses at
moderate rates for the digging of plumbago on crown lands, a certain
share of the resulting mineral also going to government. The plumbago
industry, in all its departments of mining, carting, preparing,
packing and shipping, gives employment to fully 100,000 men and
women, still almost entirely Sinhalese. The wealthiest mine-owners,
too, are Sinhalese land-owners or merchants.</p>

<p>As regards <i>gems</i>, there are perhaps 500 gem pits or quarries worked
in the island during the dry season from November to June in the
Ratnapura, Rakwane and Matara districts. Some of these are on
a small scale; but altogether several thousands of Sinhalese find a
precarious existence in digging for gems. Rich finds of a valuable
ruby, sapphire, cat&rsquo;s-eye, amethyst, alexandrite or star stone, are
comparatively rare; it is only of the commoner gems, such as
moonstone, garnet, spinels, that a steady supply is obtained. The
cat&rsquo;s-eye in its finer qualities is peculiar to Ceylon, and is occasionally
in great demand, according to the fashion. The obstacle to the
investment of European capital in &ldquo;gemming&rdquo; has always been the
difficulty of preventing the native labourers in the pits&mdash;-even if
practically naked&mdash;from concealing and stealing gems. A Chamber of
Mines, with a suitable library, was established in Colombo during 1899.</p>

<p><i>Manufactures.</i>&mdash;Little is done save in the preparation in factories
and stores, in Colombo or on the plantations, of the several products
exported. The manufacture of jewellery and preparation of precious
stones, and, among native women and children, of pillow lace, give
employment to several thousands. Iron and engineering works are
numerous in Colombo and in the planting districts. The Sinhalese
are skilful cabinetmakers and carpenters. The Moormen and Tamils
furnish good masons and builders.</p>

<p><i>Commerce.</i>&mdash;There has been rapid development since 1882, and
the returns for 1903 showed a total value of 22½ millions sterling.
The principal imports were articles of food and drink (chiefly rice
from India) manufactured metals (with specie), coal, cotton yarns
and piece goods from Manchester, machinery and millwork and
apparel. The Ceylon customs tariff for imports is one of 6½% <i>ad
valorem</i>, save in the case of intoxicating drinks, arms, ammunition,
opium, &amp;c. The chief export is tea.</p>

<p><i>Roads.</i>&mdash;The policy of the Sinhalese rulers of the interior was to
exclude strangers from the hill country. Prior to the British occupation
of the Kandyan territory in 1815, the only means of
access from one district to another was by footpaths through the
forests. The Portuguese do not appear to have attempted to
open up the country below the hills, and the Dutch confined themselves
to the improvement of the inland water-communications.
The British government saw from the first the necessity of making
roads into the interior for military purposes, and, more recently, for
developing the resources of the country. The credit of opening up
the country is due mainly to the governor, Sir Edward Barnes, by
whose direction the great military road from Colombo to Kandy
was made. Gradually all the military stations were connected by
broad tracks, which by degrees were bridged and converted into
good carriage roads. The governors Sir Henry Ward and Sir
Hercules Robinson recognized the importance of giving the coffee
planters every assistance in opening up the country, and the result
of their policy is that the whole of the hill country is now intersected
by a vast number of splendid roads, made at a cost of upwards of
£2000 per mile. In 1848 an ordinance was passed to levy from every
adult male in the colony (except Buddhist priests and British soldiers)
six days&rsquo; labour on the roads, or an equivalent in money. The labour
and money obtained by this wise measure have enabled the local
authorities to connect the government highways by minor roads,
which bring every village of importance into communication with
the principal towns.</p>

<p><i>Railways.</i>&mdash;After repeated vain attempts by successive governors
to connect Colombo with the interior by railways, Sir Charles
MacCarthy successfully set on foot a railway of 75 m. in length from
Colombo to Kandy. The railway mileage had developed to 563 m.
in 1908, including one of the finest mountain lines in the world&mdash;over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page783" id="page783"></a>783</span>
160 m. long, rising to 6200 ft. above sea-level, and falling at the
terminus to 4000 ft. The towns of Kandy, Matale, Gampola, Nawalapitiya,
Hatton and Haputale (and practically Nuwara Eliya) in the
hills, are thus connected by rail, and in the low country the towns of
Kurunegala, Galle, Matara, Kalutara, &amp;c. Most of the debt on the
railways (all government lines) is paid off, and the traffic receipts
now make up nearly one-third of the general revenue. An Indo-Ceylon
railway to connect the Indian and Ceylon systems has been
the subject of separate reports and estimates by engineers serving
the Ceylon and Indian governments, who have pronounced the
work across the coral reef between Manaar and Rameswaram quite
feasible. A commission sat in 1903 to consider the gauge of an
Indo-Ceylon railway. Such a line promised to serve strategic as
well as commercial purposes, and to make Colombo more than ever
the port for southern India. The headquarters of the mail steamers
have been removed from Galle to Colombo, where the colonial
government have constructed a magnificent breakwater, and undertaken
other harbour works which have greatly augmented both
the external trade and the coasting trade of the island.</p>

<p><i>Government.</i>&mdash;Ceylon is a crown colony, that is, a possession of the
British crown acquired by conquest or cession, the affairs of which
are administered by a governor, who receives his appointment from
the crown, generally for a term of six years. He is assisted by an
executive and a legislative council. The executive council acts as
the cabinet of the governor, and consists of the attorney-general,
the three principal officers of the colony (namely, the colonial secretary,
the treasurer and the auditor-general), and the general in
command of the forces. The legislative council includes, besides
the governor as president and nine official members, eight unofficial
members&mdash;one for the Kandyan Sinhalese (or Highlanders) and one
for the &ldquo;Moormen&rdquo; having been added in 1890. The term of office
for the unofficial members is limited to five years, though the
governor may reappoint if he choose. The king&rsquo;s advocate, the
deputy-advocate, and the surveyor-general are now respectively
styled attorney-general, solicitor-general, and director of public
works. The civil service has been reconstituted into five classes,
not including the colonial secretary as a staff appointment, nor ten
cadets; these five classes number seventy officers. The district
judges can punish up to two years&rsquo; imprisonment, and impose
fines up to Rs.1000. The police magistrates can pass sentences
up to six months&rsquo; imprisonment, and impose fines of Rs.150. The
criminal law has since 1890 been codified on the model of the Indian
penal code; criminal and civil procedure have also been the subject
of codification. There are twenty-three prisons in the island, mostly
small; but convict establishments in and near the capital take all
long-sentence prisoners.</p>

<p><i>Banks and Currency.</i>&mdash;Ceylon has agencies of the National Bank
of India, Bank of Madras, Mercantile Bank of India, Chartered Bank
of India, Australia and China, and of the Hong-kong and Shanghai
Bank, besides mercantile agencies of other banks, also a government
savings bank at Colombo, and post-office savings banks all
over the island. In 1884, on the failure of the Oriental Bank, the
notes in currency were guaranteed by government, and a government
note currency was started in supersession of bank notes. The coin
currency of Ceylon is in rupees and decimals of a rupee, the value
of the standard following that fixed for the Indian rupee, about
1s. 4d. per rupee.</p>

<p><i>Finance.</i>&mdash;With the disease of the coffee plant the general revenue
fell from Rs.1,70,00,000 in 1877 to Rs.1,20,00,000 in 1882, when
trade was in a very depressed state, and the general prosperity of
the island was seriously affected. Since then, however, the revenue
has steadily risen with the growing export of tea, cocoa-nut produce,
plumbago, &amp;c., and in 1902 it reached a total of 28 millions of
rupees.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The island of Ceylon was known to the Greeks and
Romans under the name of <i>Taprobane</i>, and in later times Serendib,
Sirinduil and Zeylan have been employed to designate it by
writers of the Western and Eastern worlds. Serendib is a
corruption of the Sanskrit <i>Sinhaladvïpa</i>. Like most oriental
countries, Ceylon possesses a great mass of ancient records, in
which fact is so confused with fable that they are difficult to
distinguish. The labours of George Turnour (1799-1843),
however, helped to dissipate much of this obscurity, and his
admirable edition (1836) of the <i>Mahavamsa</i> first made it possible
to trace the main lines of Sinhalese history.</p>

<p>The Sinhalese inscriptional records, to which George Turnour
first called attention, and which, through the activity of Sir
William Gregory in 1874, began to be accurately transcribed
and translated, extend from the 2nd century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> onwards.
Among the oldest inscriptions discovered are those on the rock
cells of the Vessagiri Vihara of Anuradhapura, cut in the old
Brahma-lipi character. The inscriptions show how powerful
was the Buddhist hierarchy which dominated the government
and national life. The royal decrees of successive rulers are
mainly concerned with the safeguarding of the rights of the
hierarchy, but a few contain references to executive acts of the
kings, as in a slab inscription of Kassapa V. (c. <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 929-939).
In an edict ascribed to Mahinda IV. (c. <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 975-991) reference
is made to the Sinhalese palladium, the famous tooth-relic of
Buddha, now enshrined at Kandy, and the decree confirms
tradition as to the identity of the fine stone temple, east of the
Thuparama at Anuradhapura, with the shrine in which the
tooth was first deposited when brought from Kalinga in the
reign of Kirti Sri Meghavarna (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 304-324).</p>

<p>The earliest inhabitants of Ceylon were probably the ancestors
of the modern Veddahs, a small tribe of primitive hunters who
inhabit the eastern jungles; and the discovery of palaeolithic
stone implements buried in some of their caves points to the fact
that they represent a race which has been in the island for untold
ages. As to subsequent immigrations, the great Hindu epic,
the <i>Ramayana</i>, tells the story of the conquest of part of the
island by the hero Rama and his followers, who took the capital
of its king Rawana. Whatever element of truth there may be
in this fable, it certainly represents no permanent occupation.
The authentic history of Ceylon, so far as it can be traced,
begins with the landing in 543 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> of Vijaya, the founder of the
Sinhalese dynasty, with a small band of Aryan-speaking followers
from the mainland of India. Vijaya married the daughter of a
native chief, with whose aid he proceeded to master the whole
island, which he parcelled out among his followers, some of whom
formed petty kingdoms. The Sinhalese introduced from the
mainland a comparatively high type of civilization, notably
agriculture. The earliest of the great irrigation tanks, near
Anuradhapura, was opened about 504 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> by the successor of
Vijaya; and about this time was established that system of
village communities which still obtains over a large part of Ceylon.</p>

<p>The island was converted to Buddhism at the beginning of
the 3rd century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> by the preaching of Mahinda, a son of the
great Buddhist emperor Asoka; a conversion that was followed
by an immense multiplication of <i>daghobas</i>, curious bell-shaped
reliquaries of solid stone, and of Buddhist monasteries. For
the rest, the history of ancient Ceylon is largely a monotonous
record of Malabar or Tamil invasions, conquests and usurpations.
Of these latter the first was in 237 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> when two officers in the
cavalry and fleet revolted, overthrew the Sinhalese ruler with
the aid of his own Tamil mercenaries, and reigned jointly, as
Sena I. and Guptika, until 215. The Sinhalese Asela then ruled
till 205, when he was overthrown by a Tamil from Tanjore,
Elala, who held the reins of power for 44 years. In 161 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>
Elala was defeated and slain by Dutegemunu, still remembered
as one of the great Sinhalese heroes of Ceylon. The ruins of the
great monastery, known as the Brazen Palace, at Anuradhapura,
remain a memorial of King Dutegemunu&rsquo;s splendour and religious
zeal. He died in 137 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, and thenceforth the history of Ceylon
is mainly that of further Tamil invasions, of the construction
of irrigation tanks, and of the immense development of the
Buddhist monastic system. A tragic episode in the royal family
in the 5th century <span class="scs">A.D.</span> is, however, worthy of notice as connected
with one of Ceylon&rsquo;s most interesting remains, the S&#299;giri rock
and tank (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">S&#299;giri</a></span>). In <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 477 King Datu Sen was murdered
by his son, who mounted the throne as Kasyapa I., and when
he was driven from the capital by the inhabitants, infuriated
by his crime, built himself a stronghold on the inaccessible
S&#299;giri rock, whence he ruled the country until in 495 he was
overthrown and slain by his brother Mugallana (495-513), who
at the time of his father&rsquo;s murder had escaped to India.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the 10th century Ceylon was invaded by
Rajaraja the Great, the Chola king, and after a series of protracted
campaigns was annexed to his empire in 1005. The
island, did not, however, remain long under Tamil domination.
In 1071 Vijaya Bahu succeeded in re-establishing the Sinhalese
dynasty, and for a while Ceylon was freed from foreign intervention.
The most notable of the successors of Vijaya Bahu,
and indeed of all the long line of Sinhalese rulers, was Parakrama
Bahu I. (1155-1180), whose colossal statue still stands near
Polonnaruwa. He not only took advantage of the unaccustomed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page784" id="page784"></a>784</span>
tranquillity of the country to restore the irrigation tanks and
the monasteries, but he availed himself of a disputed succession
to the Pandya throne of Madura to turn the tables on his Tamil
enemies by invading India. According to the <i>Mahavamsa</i> his
generals met with immediate and unbroken success; according
to the more probable account preserved in a long Chola inscription
at Arpakkam near Kanchi, they were, though at first
successful, ultimately driven out by a coalition of the southern
princes (V.A. Smith, <i>Early History of India</i>, ed. 1908, p. 411).
In any case, within thirty years of Parakrama Bahu&rsquo;s death
his work was undone; the Malabar invaders were once more
able to effect a settlement in the island, and the Sinhalese capital
was moved farther and farther south, till in 1410 it had become
established at Kotta, now a suburb of Colombo. In 1408 a new
misfortune had befallen the Sinhalese dynasty; in revenge for
an insult offered to a Chinese envoy, a Chinese army invaded
the island and carried away King Vijaya Bahu IV. into captivity.
For thirty years from this date the Sinhalese kings of Ceylon
were tributary to China.</p>

<p>When, in 1505, the Portuguese Francisco de Almeida landed
in Ceylon, he found the island divided into seven kingdoms.
Twelve years later the viceroy of Goa ordered the erection of a
fort at Colombo, for which permission was obtained from the
king of Kotta; and from this time until the advent of the Dutch
in the 17th century the Portuguese endeavoured, amid perpetual
wars with the native kings, who were assisted by Arab and other
traders jealous of European rivalry, to establish their control
over the island. They ultimately succeeded so far as the coast
was concerned, though their dominion scarcely penetrated inland.
Materially their gain was but small, for the trade of Ceylon was
quite insignificant; but they had the spiritual satisfaction of
prosecuting a vigorous propaganda of Catholicism, St Francis
Xavier being the most notable of the missionaries who at this
time laboured in the island.</p>

<p>The fanatical zeal and the masterful attitude of the Portuguese
were a constant source of dissension with the native rulers, and
when the Dutch, under Admiral Spilberg, landed on the east
coast in 1602 and sought the alliance of the king of Kandy in
the interior of the island, every inducement was held out to them
to aid in expelling the Portuguese. Nothing seems to have come
of this until 1638-1639, when a Dutch expedition attacked and
razed the Portuguese forts on the east coast. In the following
year they landed at Negombo, without however establishing
themselves in any strong post. In 1644 Negombo was captured
and fortified by the Dutch, while in 1656 they took Colombo,
and in 1658 they drove the Portuguese from Jaffna, their last
stronghold in Ceylon.</p>

<p>Pursuing a wiser policy than their predecessors, the Dutch
lost no opportunity of improving that portion of the country
which owned their supremacy, and of opening a trade with the
interior. More tolerant and less disposed to stand upon their
dignity than the Portuguese, they subordinated political to commercial
ends, flattered the native rulers by a show of deference,
and so far succeeded in their object as to render their trade
between the island and Holland a source of great profit. Many
new branches of industry were developed. Public works were
undertaken on a large scale, and education, if not universally
placed within the reach of the inhabitants of the maritime
provinces, was at least well cared for on a broad plan of government
supervision. That which they had so much improved by
policy, they were, however, unable to defend by force when the
British turned their arms against them. A century and a half
had wrought great changes in the physical and mental status
of the Dutch colonists. The territory which in 1658 they had
slowly gained by undaunted and obstinate bravery, they as
rapidly lost in 1796 by imbecility and cowardice.</p>

<p>The first intercourse of the English with Ceylon was as far
back as 1763, when an embassy was despatched from Madras
to the king of Kandy, without, however, leading to any result.
On the rupture between Great Britain and Holland in 1795, a
force was sent against the Dutch possessions in Ceylon, where
the opposition offered was so slight that by the following year
the whole of their forts were in the hands of the English
commander.</p>

<p>The abiding results of the occupation of Ceylon by the
Portuguese and Dutch is described by Sir Emerson Tennent
(<i>Ceylon</i>) as follows:</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;The dominion of the Netherlands in Ceylon was nearly equal in
duration with that of Portugal, about 140 years; but the policies
of the two countries have left a very different impress on the character
and institutions of the people amongst whom they lived. The
most important bequest left by the utilitarian genius of Holland is
the code of Roman Dutch law, which still prevails in the supreme
courts of justice, whilst the fanatical propagandism of the Portuguese
has reared for itself a monument in the abiding and expanding
influence of the Roman Catholic faith. This flourishes in every
hamlet and province where it was implanted by the Franciscans,
whilst the doctrines of the reformed church of Holland, never
preached beyond the walls of the fortresses, are already almost
forgotten throughout the island, with the exception of an expiring
community at Colombo. Already the language of the Dutch, which
they sought to extend by penal enactments, has ceased to be spoken
even by their direct descendants, whilst a corrupted Portuguese is
to the present day the vernacular of the lower classes in every town
of importance. As the practical and sordid government of the
Netherlands only recognized the interest of the native population
in so far as they were essential to uphold their trading monopolies,
their memory was recalled by no agreeable associations: whilst the
Portuguese, who, in spite of their cruelties, were identified with the
people by the bond of a common faith, excited a feeling of admiration
by the boldness of their conflicts with the Kandyans, and the
chivalrous though ineffectual defence of their beleaguered fortresses.
The Dutch and their proceedings have almost ceased to be remembered
by the lowland Sinhalese; but the chiefs of the south and
west perpetuate with pride the honorific title Don, accorded to them
by their first European conquerors, and still prefix to their ancient
patronymics the sonorous Christian names of the Portuguese.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>The British forces by which the island had been conquered
were those of the East India Company, and Ceylon was therefore
at first placed under its jurisdiction and administered from
Madras. The introduction of the Madras revenue system, however,
together with a host of Malabar collectors, led to much
discontent, which culminated in rebellion; and in 1798 the
colony was placed directly under the crown. By the treaty of
Amiens, in 1803, this situation was regularized, from the international
point of view, by the formal cession to Great Britain
of the former Dutch possessions in the island. For a while the
British dominion was confined to the coast. The central tract
of hilly country, hedged in by impenetrable forests and precipitous
mountain ranges, remained in possession of Sri Vikrama
Raja Sinha, the last of the Sinhalese dynasty, who showed
no signs of encouraging communication with his European
neighbours.</p>

<p>Minor differences led in 1803 to an invasion of the Kandyan
territory; but sickness, desertion and fatigue proved more
formidable adversaries to the British forces than the troops of
the Sinhalese monarch, and peace was eventually concluded upon
terms by no means favourable to the English. The cruelty and
oppression of the king now became so intolerable to his subjects
that disaffection spread rapidly amongst them. Punishments
of the most horrible kinds were inflicted, but failed to repress
the popular indignation; and in 1815 the British, at the urgent
request of many of the Adigars and other native chiefs, proceeded
against the tyrant, who was captured near Kandy, and subsequently
ended his days in exile. With him ended a long line of
sovereigns, whose pedigree may be traced through upwards of
two thousand years.</p>

<p>By a convention entered into with the Kandyan chiefs on the
2nd of March 1815, the entire sovereignty of the island passed
into the hands of the British, who in return guaranteed to the
inhabitants civil and religious liberty. The religion of Buddha
was declared inviolable, and its rights, ministers and places of
worship were to be maintained and protected; the laws of the
country were to be preserved and administered according to
established forms; and the royal dues and revenues were to be
levied as before for the support of government.</p>

<p>With the exception of a serious outbreak in some parts of the
interior in 1817, which lasted for upwards of a year, and of two
minor attempts at rebellion easily put down, in 1843 and 1848,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page785" id="page785"></a>785</span>
the political atmosphere of Ceylon has remained undisturbed
since the deportation of the last king of Kandy.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHABAZITE,<a name="ar42" id="ar42"></a></span> a mineral species belonging to the group of
zeolites. It occurs as white to flesh-red crystals which vary from
transparent to translucent and have a vitreous lustre. The
crystals are rhombohedral, and the predominating form is often
a rhombohedron (<i>r</i>) with interfacial angles of 85° 14&prime;; they
therefore closely resemble cubes in appearance, and the mineral
was in fact early (in 1772) described as a cubic zeolite. A
characteristic feature is the twinning, the crystals being frequently
interpenetration twins with the principal axis as twin-axis
(figs, 1, 2). The appearance shown in fig. 1, with the corners
of small crystals in twinned position projecting from the faces
<i>r</i> of the main crystal, is especially characteristic of chabazite.
Such groups resemble the interpenetrating twinned cubes of
fluorspar, but the two minerals are readily distinguished by
their cleavage, fluorspar having a perfect octahedral cleavage
truncating the corners of the cube, whilst in chabazite there are
less distinct cleavages parallel to the rhombohedral (cube-like)
faces. Another type of twinned crystal is represented in fig. 2,
in which the predominating form is an obtuse hexagonal pyramid
(<i>t</i>); the faces of these flatter crystals are often rounded, giving
rise to lenticular shapes, hence the name phacolite (from <span class="grk" title="phakos">&#966;&#945;&#954;&#972;&#962;</span>,
a lentil) for this variety of chabazite.</p>

<p>The hardness of chabazite is 4½, and the specific gravity
2.08-2.16. As first noticed by Sir David Brewster in 1830, the
crystals often exhibit anomalous optical characters: instead
of being uniaxial, a basal section may be divided into sharply-defined
biaxial sectors. Heating of the crystals is attended by
a loss of water and a change in their optical characters; it is
probable therefore that the anomalous optical characters are
dependent on the amount of water present.</p>

<p>Besides phacolite, mentioned above, other varieties of chabazite
are distinguished. Herschelite and seebachite are essentially
the same as phacolite. Haydenite is the name given to small
yellowish crystals, twinned on a rhombohedron plane <i>r</i>, from
Jones&rsquo;s Falls near Baltimore in Maryland. Acadialite is a
reddish chabazite from Nova Scotia (the old French name of
which is Acadie).</p>

<p>Chemically, chabazite is a complex hydrated calcium and
sodium silicate, with a small proportion of the sodium replaced by
potassium, and sometimes a small amount of the calcium replaced
by barium and strontium. The composition is however variable,
and is best expressed as an isomorphous mixture of the molecules
(Ca, Na<span class="su">2</span>) Al<span class="su">2</span>(SiO<span class="su">4</span>)<span class="su">2</span> + 4H<span class="su">2</span>O and (Ca, Na<span class="su">2</span>) Al<span class="su">2</span>(Si<span class="su">3</span>O<span class="su">8</span>)<span class="su">2</span> + 8H<span class="su">2</span>O,
which are analogous to the felspars. Most analyses correspond
with a formula midway between these extremes, namely,
(Ca, Na<span class="su">2</span>)Al<span class="su">2</span>(SiO<span class="su">3</span>)<span class="su">4</span> + 6H<span class="su">2</span>O.</p>

<p>Chabazite occurs with other zeolites in the amygdaloidal
cavities of basaltic rocks; occasionally it has been found in
gneisses and schists. Well-formed crystals are known from
many localities; for example, Kilmalcolm in Renfrewshire, the
Giant&rsquo;s Causeway in Co. Antrim, and Oberstein in Germany.
Beautiful, clear glassy crystals of the phacolite (&ldquo;seebachite&rdquo;)
variety occur with phillipsite and radiating bundles of brown
calcite in cavities in compact basalt near Richmond, Melbourne,
Victoria. Small crystals have been observed lining the cavities
of fossil shells from Iceland, and in the recent deposits of the
hot springs of Plombières and Bourbonne-les-Bains in France.</p>

<p>Gmelinite and levynite are other species of zeolites which may
be mentioned here, since they are closely related to chabazite,
and like it are rhombohedral and frequently twinned. Gmelinite
forms large flesh-red crystals usually of hexagonal habit, and
was early known as soda-chabazite, it having the composition
of chabazite but with sodium predominating over
calcium (Na<span class="su">2</span>, Ca)Al<span class="su">2</span>(SiO<span class="su">3</span>)<span class="su">4</span>6H<span class="su">2</span>O. The formula of levynite is
CaAl<span class="su">2</span>Si<span class="su">3</span>O<span class="su">10</span> + 5H<span class="su">2</span>O.</p>

The Chabot family was one of the oldest and most powerful in
Poitou. Philippe was a cadet of the Jarnac branch. He was a
companion of Francis I. as a child, and on that king&rsquo;s accession
was loaded with honours and estates. After the battle of Pavia
he was made admiral of France and governor of Burgundy
(1526), and shared with Anne de Montmorency the direction of
affairs. He was at the height of his power in 1535, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page786" id="page786"></a>786</span>
commanded the army for the invasion of the states of the duke of
Savoy; but in the campaigns of 1536 and 1537 he was eclipsed
by Montmorency, and from that moment his influence began to
wane. He was accused by his enemies of peculation, and
condemned on the 10th of February 1541 to a fine of 1,500,000
livres, to banishment, and to the confiscation of his estates.
Through the good offices of Madam d&rsquo;Étampes, however, he
obtained the king&rsquo;s pardon almost immediately (March 1541),
was reinstated in his posts, and regained his estates and even
his influence, while Montmorency in his turn was disgraced.
But his health was affected by these troubles, and he died soon
afterwards on the 1st of June 1543. His tomb in the Louvre,
by an unknown sculptor, is a fine example of French Renaissance
work. It was his nephew, Guy Chabot, seigneur de Jarnac,
who fought the famous duel with François de Vivonne, seigneur
de la Châtaigneraie, in 1547, at the beginning of the reign of
Henry II.</p>

receiving a charge on the left knee, with shields resting on the

gained a decisive victory over the Spartan fleet off Naxos, but,
when he might have destroyed the Spartan fleet, remembering
the fate of the generals at Arginusae, he delayed to pick up the
bodies of his dead. Later, when the Athenians changed sides
and joined the Spartans, he repulsed Epaminondas before the
walls of Corinth. In 366, together with Callistratus, he was

<p><span class="bold">CHABRIER, ALEXIS EMMANUEL<a name="ar48" id="ar48"></a></span> (1841-1894), French
composer, was born at Ambert, Puy de Dôme, on the 18th of
January 1841. At first he only cultivated music as an amateur,
and it was not until 1879 that he threw up an administration
appointment in order to devote himself entirely to the art. He
had two years previously written an <i>opéra bouffe</i> entitled <i>L&rsquo;Étoile</i>,
which was performed at the Bouffes Parisiens. In 1881 he was
appointed chorus-master of the concerts then recently established
by Lamoureux. In 1883 he composed the brilliant orchestral
rhapsody entitled <i>España</i>, the themes of which he had jotted
down when travelling in Spain. His opera <i>Gwendoline</i> was
brought out with considerable success at Brussels on the 10th
of April 1886, and was given later at the Paris Grand Opéra.
The following year 1887, <i>Le Roi malgré lui</i>, an opera of a lighter
description, was produced in Paris at the Opéra Comique, its
run being interrupted by the terrible fire by which this theatre
was destroyed. His last opera, <i>Briseis</i>, was left unfinished,
and performed in a fragmentary condition at the Paris Opéra,
after the composer&rsquo;s death in Paris on the 13th of September
1894. Chabrier was also the author of a set of piano pieces
entitled <i>Pièces pittoresques, Valses romantiques</i>, for two pianos,
a fantasia for horn and piano, &amp;c. His great admiration for
Wagner asserted itself in <i>Gwendoline</i>, a work which, in spite of
inequalities due to want of experience, is animated by a high
artistic ideal, is poetically conceived, and shows considerable
harmonic originality, besides a thorough mastery over the
treatment of the orchestra. The characteristics of <i>Le Roi</i>
<i>malgré lui</i> have been well summed up by M. Joncières when he
alludes to &ldquo;cette verve inépuisable, ces rythmes endiablés, cette
exubérance de gaieté et de vigueur, à laquelle venait se joindre
la note mélancolique et émue.&rdquo; Chabrier&rsquo;s premature death
prevented him from giving the full measure of his worth.</p>

by Wynfrith. Bede gives a beautiful character of Chad.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHAD,<a name="ar53" id="ar53"></a></span> a lake of northern Central Africa lying between
12° 50&prime; and 14° 10&prime; N. and 13° and 15° E. The lake is situated
about 850 ft. above the sea in the borderland between the fertile
and wooded regions of the Sudan on the south and the arid
steppes which merge into the Sahara on the north. The area of
the lake is shrinking owing to the progressive desiccation of the
country, Saharan climate and conditions replacing those of the
Sudan. The drying-up process has been comparatively rapid
since the middle of the 19th century, a town which in 1850 was
on the southern margin of the lake being in 1905 over 20 m. from
it. On the west the shore is perfectly flat, so that a slight rise
in the water causes the inundation of a considerable area&mdash;a
fact not without its influence on the estimates made at varying
periods as to the size of the lake. Around the north-west and
north shores is a continuous chain of gently sloping sand-hills
covered with bush. This region abounds in big game and birds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page787" id="page787"></a>787</span>
are plentiful. In the east, the country of Kanem, the desiccation
has been most marked. Along this coast is a continuous chain
of islands running from north-west to south-east. But what
were islands when viewed by Overweg in 1851, formed in 1903
part of the mainland and new islands had arisen in the lake.
They are generally low, being composed of sand and clay, and lie
from 5 to 20 m. from the shore, which throughout its eastern side
nowhere faces open water. The channels between the islands
do not exceed 2 m. in width. Two principal groups are distinguished,
the Kuri archipelago in the south, and the Buduma
in the north. The inhabitants of the last-named islands were
noted pirates until reduced to order by the French. The coast-line
is, in general, undefined and marshy, and broken into numerous
bays and peninsulas. It is also, especially on the east,
lined by lagoons which communicate with the lake by intricate
channels. The lake is nowhere of great depth, and about midway
numerous mud-banks, marshes, islands and dense growths of
aqueous plants stretch across its surface. Another stretch
of marsh usually cuts off the northernmost part of the lake from
the central sections. The open water varies in depth from 3 ft.
in the north-west to over 20 in the south, where desiccation
is less apparent. Fed by the Shari (<i>q.v.</i>) and other rivers, the
lake has no outlet and its area varies according to the season.
The flood water brought down by the Shari in December and
January causes the lake to rise to a maximum of 24 ft., the
water spreading over low-lying ground, left dry again in May or
June. But after several seasons of heavy rainfall the waters
have remained for years beyond their low-water level. Nevertheless
the secular shrinking goes on, the loss by evaporation and
percolation exceeding the amount of water received; whilst,
on the average, the rainfall is diminishing. In 1870 the lake
rose to an exceptional height, but since then, save in 1897, there
has been only the normal seasonal rise. The prevalent north-east
wind causes at times a heavy swell on the lake. Fish
abound in its waters, which are sweet, save at low-level, when
they become brackish. The lagoons are believed to act as
purifying pans in which the greater part of the salt in the water
is precipitated. In the south-west end of the lake the water is
yellow, caused by banks of clay; elsewhere it is clear.</p>

<div class="center ptb1"><img style="width:513px; height:533px" src="images/img787.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>The southern basin of Chad is described under the Shari,
which empties its waters into the lake about the middle of the
southern shore, forming a delta of considerable extent. Beyond
the south-east corner of the lake is a depression known as the
Bahr-el-Ghazal (not to be confounded with the Nile affluent of
the same name). This depression is the termination of what is
in all probability the bed of one of the dried-up Saharan rivers.
Coming from the Tibesti highlands the Bahr-el-Ghazal has a
south-westerly trend to Lake Chad. Near the lake the valley
was formerly swampy, and at high-water the lake overflowed into
it. There was also at one time communication between the
Shari and the Bahr-el-Ghazal, so that the water of the first-named
stream reached Chad by way of the Bahr-el-Ghazal.
There is now neither inlet nor outlet to the lake in this direction,
the mouth of the Ghazal having become a fertile millet field.
There is still, however, a distinct current from the Shari delta
to the east end of the lake&mdash;known to the natives, like the depression
beyond, as the Bahr-el-Ghazal&mdash;indicative of the former
overflow outlet.</p>

<p>Besides the Shari, the only important stream entering Lake
Chad is the Waube or Yo (otherwise the Komadugu Yobe),
which rises near Kano, and flowing eastward enters the lake on its
western side 40 m. north of Kuka. In the rains the Waube
carries down a considerable body of water to the lake.</p>

<p>Lake Chad is supposed to have been known by report to
Ptolemy, and is identified by some writers with the Kura lake
of the middle ages. It was first seen by white men in 1823
when it was reached by way of Tripoli by the British expedition
under Dr Walter Oudney, R.N., the other members being Captain
Hugh Clapperton and Major (afterwards Lieut.-Colonel) Dixon
Denham. By them the lake was named Waterloo. In 1850
James Richardson, accompanied by Heinrich Barth and Adolf
Overweg, reached the lake, also via Tripoli, and Overweg was
the first European to navigate its waters (1851). The lake was
visited by Eduard Vogel (1855) and by Gustav Nachtigal (1870),
the last-named investigating its hydrography in some detail.
In 1890-1893 its shores were divided by treaty between Great
Britain, France and Germany. The first of these nations to
make good its footing in the region was France. A small steamer,
brought from the Congo by Emile Gentil, was in 1897 launched
on the Shari, and reaching the Chad, navigated the southern
part of the lake. Communication between Algeria and Lake Chad
by way of the Sahara was opened, after repeated failures, by the
French explorer F. Foureau in 1899-1900. At the same time
a French officer, Lieut. Joalland, reached the lake from the
middle Niger, continuing his journey round the north end to
Kanem. A British force under Colonel T.L.N. Morland visited
the lake at the beginning of 1902, and in May of the same year
the Germans first reached it from Cameroon. In 1902-1903
French officers under Colonel Destenave made detailed surveys
of the south-eastern and eastern shores and the adjacent islands.
In 1903 Captain E. Lenfant, also a French officer, succeeded in
reaching the lake (which he circumnavigated) via the Benue,
proving the existence of water communication between the Shari
and the Niger. In 1905 Lieut. Boyd Alexander, a British
officer, further explored the lake, which then contained few
stretches of open water. The lake is bordered W. and S.W. by
Bornu, which is partly in the British protectorate of Nigeria
and partly in the German protectorate of Cameroon. Bagirmi
to the S.E. of the lake and Kanem to the N.E. are both French
possessions. The north and north-west shores also belong to
France. One of the ancient trade routes across the Sahara&mdash;that
from Tripoli to Kuka in Bornu&mdash;strikes the lake at its north-west
corner, but this has lost much of its former importance.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page788" id="page788"></a>788</span>
a gentleman of an ancient and wealthy family, and a zealous
Catholic. Under the tuition of Laurence Vaux, a priest, he
became an able scholar. In 1564 he entered Christ&rsquo;s College,
Cambridge, where, after a short time, he formally adopted the
reformed doctrines and was in consequence disinherited by his
father. In 1567 he was elected a fellow of his college, and
subsequently was chosen lecturer of St Clement&rsquo;s church,
Cambridge, where he preached to admiring audiences for many
years. He was a man of moderate views, though numbering
among his friends extremists like Cartwright and Perkins. So
great was his reputation that when Sir Walter Mildmay founded
Emmanuel College in 1584 he chose Chaderton for the first
master, and on his expressing some reluctance, declared that if
he would not accept the office the foundation should not go on.
In 1604 Chaderton was appointed one of the four divines for
managing the cause of the Puritans at the Hampton Court
conference; and he was also one of the translators of the Bible.
In 1578 he had taken the degree of B.D., and in 1613 he was
created D.D. At this period he made provision for twelve
fellows and above forty scholars in Emmanuel College. Fearing
that he might have a successor who held Arminian doctrines,
he resigned the mastership in favour of John Preston, but
survived him, and lived also to see the college presided over
successively by William Sancroft (or Sandcroft) and Richard
Holdsworth. He died on the 13th of November 1640 at the age
of about 103, preserving his bodily and mental faculties to the end.</p>

essays in the <i>Westminster Review</i> (mainly on different methods
of applying scientific knowledge to the business of government)

him as a literary assistant and left him a handsome legacy. In
1832 he was employed by the royal commission appointed to
inquire into the operation of the poor laws, and in 1833 he was
made a full member of that body. In conjunction with Nassau
W. Senior he drafted the celebrated report of 1834 which procured
the reform of the old poor law. His special contribution was the
institution of the union as the area of administration. He
favoured, however, a much more centralized system of
administration than was adopted, and he never ceased to complain
that the reform of 1834 was fatally marred by the rejection of
his views, which contemplated the management of poor-law
relief by salaried officers controlled from a central board,
the boards of guardians acting merely as inspectors. In 1834
he was appointed secretary to the poor law commissioners.
Finding himself unable to administer in accordance with his
own views an act of which he was largely the author, his relations
with his official chiefs became much strained, and the disagreement
led, among other causes, to the dissolution of the poor law
commission in 1846. Chadwick&rsquo;s chief contribution to political
controversy was his constant advocacy of entrusting certain
departments of local affairs to trained and selected experts,
instead of to representatives elected on the principle of local
self-government. While still officially connected with the poor
law he had taken up the question of sanitation in conjunction
with Dr Southwood Smith, and their joint labours produced a
most salutary improvement in the public health. His report
on &ldquo;The Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population&rdquo;
(1842) is a valuable historical document. He was a commissioner
of the Board of Health from its establishment in 1848 to its
abolition in 1854, when he retired upon a pension, and occupied
the remainder of his life in voluntary contributions to sanitary
and economical questions. He died at East Sheen, Surrey, on
the 6th of July 1890. He had been made K.C.B. in 1889.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAEREMON,<a name="ar57" id="ar57"></a></span> Athenian dramatist of the first half of the
4th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> He is generally considered a tragic poet.
Aristotle (<i>Rhetoric</i>, iii. 12) says his works were intended for
reading, not for representation. According to Suidas, he was
also a comic poet, and the title of at least one of his plays (<i>Achilles
Slayer of Thersites</i>) seems to indicate that it was a satyric drama.
His <i>Centaurus</i> is described by Aristotle (<i>Poet.</i> i. 12) as a rhapsody
in all kinds of metres. The fragments of Chaeremon are distinguished
by correctness of form and facility of rhythm, but
marred by a florid and affected style reminiscent of Agathon.
He especially excelled in descriptions (irrelevantly introduced)
dealing with such subjects as flowers and female beauty. It is
not agreed whether he is the author of three epigrams in the
Greek Anthology (Palatine vii. 469, 720, 721) which bear
his name.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAEREMON,<a name="ar58" id="ar58"></a></span> of Alexandria (1st century <span class="scs">A.D.</span>), Stoic philosopher
and grammarian. He was superintendent of the portion
of the Alexandrian library that was kept in the temple of
Serapis, and as custodian and expounder of the sacred books
(<span class="grk" title="ierogrammateus">&#7985;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#947;&#961;&#945;&#956;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#941;&#973;&#962;</span> sacred scribe) belonged to the higher ranks of
the priesthood. In <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 49 he was summoned to Rome, with
Alexander of Aegae, to become tutor to the youthful Nero.
He was the author of a <i>History of Egypt</i>; of works on <i>Comets,
Egyptian Astrology</i>, and <i>Hieroglyphics</i>; and of a grammatical
treatise on <i>Expletive Conjunctions</i> (<span class="grk" title="syndesmoi paraplêrôpaeromatikoi">&#963;&#965;&#957;&#948;&#949;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#8054; &#960;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#960;&#955;&#951;&#961;&#969;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#943;</span>).
Chaeremon was the chief of the party which explained the
Egyptian religious system as a mere allegory of the worship of
nature. His books were not intended to represent the ideas of his
Egyptian contemporaries; their chief object was to give a
description of the sanctity and symbolical secrets of ancient
Egypt. He can hardly be identical with the Chaeremon who
accompanied (c. 26 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>; Strabo xvii. p. 806) Aelius Gallus,
praefect of Egypt, on a journey into the interior of the country.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAERONEIA,<a name="ar59" id="ar59"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Chaeronea</span>, an ancient town of Boeotia,
said by some to be the Homeric Arne, situated about 7 m. W.
of Orchomenus. Until the 4th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> it was a dependency
of Orchomenus, and at all times it played but a subordinate
part in Boeotian politics. Its importance lay in its strategic
position near the head of the defile which presents the last serious
obstacle to an invader in central Greece. Two great battles
were fought on this site in antiquity. In 338 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Philip II.
and Alexander of Macedon were confronted by a confederate
host from central Greece and Peloponnese under the leadership
of Thebes and Athens, which here made the last stand on behalf
of Greek liberty. A hard-fought conflict, in which the Greek
infantry displayed admirable firmness, was decided in favour
of Philip through the superior organization of his army. In 86
<span class="scs">B.C.</span> the Roman general L. Cornelius Sulla defeated the army of
Mithradates VI., king of Pontus, near Chaeroneia. The latter&rsquo;s
enormous numerical superiority was neutralized by Sulla&rsquo;s
judicious choice of ground and the steadiness of his legionaries;
the Asiatics after the failure of their attack were worn down and
almost annihilated. Chaeroneia is also notable as the birthplace
of Plutarch, who returned to his native town in old age,
and was held in honour by its citizens for many successive
generations. Pausanias (ix. 40) mentions the divine honours
accorded at Chaeroneia to the sceptre of Agamemnon, the work
of Hephaestus (cf. <i>Iliad</i>, ii. 101). The site of the town is partly
occupied by the village of Kapraena; the ancient citadel was
known as the Petrachus, and there is a theatre cut in the rock.
A colossal seated lion a little to the S.E. of the site marks the
grave of the Boeotians who fell fighting against Philip; this
lion was found broken to pieces; the tradition that it was blown
up by Odysseus Androutsos is incorrect (see Murray, <i>Handbook
for Greece</i>, ed. 5, 1884, p. 409). It has now been restored and
re-erected (1905).</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAETOGNATHA,<a name="ar60" id="ar60"></a></span> the name given by R. Leuckhart to a small
group of transparent and for the most part pelagic organisms,
whose position in the animal kingdom is
a very isolated one. Only three genera,
<i>Sagitta</i>, <i>Spadella</i> and <i>Krohnia</i>, are recognised,
and the number of species is small.
Nevertheless these animals exist in extraordinary
quantities, so that at certain
seasons and under certain conditions the
surface of the sea seems almost stiff with
the incredible multitude of organisms
which pervade it. Rough seas, &amp;c., cause
them to seek safety in dropping into
deeper water. Deep-sea forms also occur,
but in spite of this the group is essentially
pelagic.</p>



<div class="condensed">
<p>As a rule the body is some 1 to 2 or 3 cm.
in length, though some species are larger, by
4 or 5 mm. in breadth, and it is shaped
something like a torpedo with side flanges
and a slightly swollen, rounded head. It
can be divided into three regions&mdash;(i.) head,
(ii.) trunk, and (iii.) tail, separated from one
another by two transverse septa. The
almost spherical head is covered by a hood
which can be retracted; it bears upon its
side a number of sickle-shaped, chitinous
hooks and one or more short rows of low
spines&mdash;both of these features are used in
characterizing the various species. A pair
of eyes lie dorsally and behind them is a
closed circlet, often pulled out into various
shapes, of modified epidermis, to which an
olfactory function has been attributed. The
interior of the head is filled up with masses
of muscle fibres which are mainly occupied
with moving the sickle-shaped hooks. The
trunk contains a spacious body-cavity filled
during the breeding season by the swollen
ovaries, and the same is true of the tail if
we substitute testes for ovaries.</p>

<p>The skin consists of a transparent cuticle
excreted by the underlying ectoderm, the
cells of which though usually one-layered
may be heaped up into several layers in
the head; beneath this is a basement
membrane, and then a layer of longitudinal
muscle fibres which are limited inside by a
layer of peritoneal cells. The muscles are
striated and arranged in four quadrants,
two dorso-lateral and two ventro-lateral,
an arrangement which recalls that of the
Nematoda, whilst in their histology they
somewhat resemble the muscles of the
Oligochaeta. Along each side of the body
stretches a horizontal fin and a similar
flange surrounds the tail. Into these fins,
which are largely cuticular and strengthened
by radiating bars, a single layer of ectoderm
cells projects.</p>

<p>The mouth, a longitudinal slit, opens on
to the ventral surface of the head. It leads
into a straight alimentary canal whose walls
consist of a layer of ciliated cells ensheathed
in a thin layer of peritoneal cells. There is
no armature, and no glands, and the whole
tract can only be divided into an oesophagus
and an intestine. The latter runs with no
twists or coils straight to the anus, which is
situated at the junction of the trunk with
the tail. A median mesentery running dorso-ventrally
supports the alimentary canal and
is continued behind it into the tail, thus
dividing the body cavity into two lateral
halves.</p>

<p>There are no specialized circulatory,
respiratory or excretory organs.</p>

<p>The nervous system consists of a cerebral ganglion in the head,
a conspicuous ventral ganglion in the trunk, and of lateral commissures
uniting these ganglia on each side. The whole of this
system has retained its primitive connexion with the ectoderm.
The cerebral ganglion also gives off a nerve on each side to a pair of
small-ganglia, united by a median commissure, which have sunk
into and control the muscles of the head. As in other animals there
is a minute but extensive nervous plexus, which permeates the whole
body and takes its origin from the chief ganglia. In addition to the
eyes and the olfactory circle on the head scattered tactile papillae
are found on the ectoderm.</p>

<p>Chaetognatha are hermaphrodite. The ovaries are attached to
the side walls of the trunk region; between them and the body wall
lie the two oviducts whose inner and anterior end is described as
closed, their outer ends opening one on each side of the anus, where
the trunk joins the tail. According to Miss N.M. Stevens the so-called
oviduct acts only as a &ldquo;sperm-duct&rdquo; or receptaculum seminis.
The spermatozoa enter it and pass through its walls and traverse a
minute duct formed of two accessory cells, and finally enter the
ripe ovum. Temporary oviducts are formed between the &ldquo;sperm-duct&rdquo;
and the germinal epithelium at each oviposition. A number
of ova ripen simultaneously. The two testes lie in the tail and are
formed by lateral proliferations of the living peritoneal cells. These
break off and, lying in the coelomic fluid, break up into spermatozoa.
They pass out through short vasa deferentia with internal ciliated
funnels, sometimes an enlargement on their course&mdash;the seminal
vesicles&mdash;and a minute external pore situated on the side of the tail.</p>

<p>With hardly an exception the transparent eggs are laid into the
sea and float on its surface. The development is direct and there is
no larval stage. The segmentation is complete; one side of the
hollow blastosphere invaginates and forms a gastrula. The blastopore
closes, a new mouth and a new anus subsequently arising.
The archenteron gives off two lateral pounchs and thus becomes
trilobed. The middle lobe forms the alimentary canal; it closes
behind and opens to the exterior anteriorly and so makes the mouth.
The two lateral lobes contain the coelom; each separates off in front
a segment which forms the head and presumably then divides again
to form anteriorly the trunk, and posteriorly the tail regions. An
interesting feature of the development of Chaetognaths is that,
as in some insects, the cells destined to form the reproductive organs
are differentiated at a very early period, being apparent even in the
gastrula stage.</p>

<p>The great bulk of the group is pelagic, as the transparent nature
of all their tissues indicates. They move by flexing their bodies.
<i>Spadella cephaloptera</i> is, however, littoral and oviposits on seaweed,
and the &ldquo;Valdivia&rdquo; brought home a deep-sea species.</p>

<p>The three genera are differentiated as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sagitta</i> M. Slabber, with two pairs of lateral fins. This genus was
named as long ago as 1775.</p>

<p><i>Krohnia</i> P. Langerhans, with one lateral fin on each side, extending
on to the tail.</p>

<p><i>Spadella</i> P. Langerhans, with a pair of lateral fins on the tail and
a thickened ectodermic ridge running back on each side from the
head to the anterior end of the fin.</p>

<p>The group is an isolated one and should probably be regarded as a
separate phylum. It has certain histological resemblances with
the Nematoda and certain primitive Annelids, but little stress must
be laid on these. The most that can be said is that the Chaetognaths
begin life with three segments, a feature they share with such widely-differing
groups as the Brachiopoda, the Echinoderma and the
Enteropneusta, and probably Vertebrata generally.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAETOPODA<a name="ar61" id="ar61"></a></span> (Gr. <span class="grk" title="chaitê">&#967;&#945;&#943;&#964;&#951;</span>, hair, <span class="grk" title="pous">&#960;&#959;&#973;&#962;</span>, foot), a zoological class,
including the majority of the Annelida (<i>q.v.</i>), and indeed, save
for the Echiuroidea (<i>q.v.</i>), co-extensive with that group as
usually accepted. They are divisible into the Haplodrili (<i>q.v.</i>)
or Archiannelida, the Polychaeta containing the marine worms,
the Oligochaeta or terrestrial and fresh-water annelids (see
EARTHWORM), the Hirudinea or leeches (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Leech</a></span>), and a small
group of parasitic worms, the Myzostomida (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p>The distinctive characters of the class Chaetopoda as a whole
are partly embodied in the name. They possess (save for certain
Archiannelida, most Hirudinea, and other very rare exceptions)
setae or chaetae implanted in epidermal pits. The setae are
implanted metamerically in accordance with the metamerism
of the body, which consists of a prostomium followed by a number
of segments. The number of segments in an individual is frequently
more or less definite. The anterior end of body always
shows some &ldquo;cephalization.&rdquo; The internal organs are largely
repeated metamerically, in correspondence with the external
metamerism. Thus the body cavity is divided into a sequence
of chambers by transverse septa; and even among the Hirudinea,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page790" id="page790"></a>790</span>
where this condition is usually not to be observed, there is
embryological evidence that the existing state of affairs is derived
from this. Commonly the nephridia are strictly paired a single
pair to each segment, while the branches of the blood vascular
system are similarly metameric. The alimentary canal is nearly
always a straight tube running from the mouth, which is surrounded
by the first segment of the body and overhung by the
prostomium, to the anus, which is then either surrounded by the last
segment of the body or opens dorsally a little way in front of this.</p>

<p><span class="sc">The Class as a Whole</span>.&mdash;The Chaetopoda are with but few
exceptions (Myzostomida in part, <i>Sternaspis</i>) elongated worms,
flattened or, more usually, cylindrical, and bilaterally symmetrical.
The body consists of a number of exactly similar
or closely similar segments, which are never fused and metamorphosed,
as in the Arthropoda, to form specialized regions
of the body. It is, however, always possible to recognize a
head, which consists at least of the peristomial segment with a
forward projection of the same, the prostomium. A thorax also
is sometimes to be distinguished from an abdomen. Where
locomotive appendages (the parapodia of the Polychaeta) exist,
they are never jointed, as always in the Arthropoda; nor are
they modified anteriorly to form jaws, as in that group.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The prostomium overhangs the mouth, and is often of considerable
size and, as a rule, quite distinct from the segment following, being
separated by an external groove, and containing, at least temporarily,
the brain, which always arises there. Its cavity also is at first
independent of the coelom though later invaded by the latter. In
any case the cavity of the prostomium is single, and not formed,
as is the cavity of the segments of the body, by paired coelomic
chambers. It has, however, been alleged that this cavity is formed
by a pair of mesoblastic somites (N. Kleinenberg), in which case there
is more reason for favouring the view that would assign an equality
between the prostomium and the (in that case) other segments of the
body. The peculiar prostomium of <i>Tomopteris</i> is described below.
The body wall of the Chaetopoda consists of a &ldquo;dermo-muscular&rdquo;
tube which is separated from the gut by the coelom and its peritoneal
walls, except in most leeches. A single layer of epidermic cells, some
of which are glandular, forms the outer layer. Rarely are these
ciliated, and then only in limited tracts. They secrete a cuticle
which never approaches in thickness the often calcified cuticle of
Arthropods. Below this is a circular, and below that again a longitudinal,
layer of muscle fibres. These muscles are not striated, as
they are in the Arthropoda.</p>

<p><i>Setae</i>.&mdash;These chitinous, rod-like, rarely squat and then hook-like
structures are found in the majority of the Chaetopoda, being absent
only in certain Archiannelida, most leeches, and a very few Oligochaeta.
They exist in the Brachiopoda (which are probably not
unrelated to the Chaetopoda), but otherwise are absolutely distinctive
of the Chaetopods. The setae are invariably formed each within
an epidermic cell, and they are sheathed in involutions of the epidermis.
Their shape and size varies greatly and is often of use in
classification. The setae are organs of locomotion, though their
large size and occasionally jagged edges in some of the Polychaeta
suggest an aggressive function. They are disposed in two groups on
either side, corresponding in the Polychaeta to the parapodia;
the two bundles are commonly reduced among the earthworms to
two pairs of setae or even to a single seta. On the other hand, in
certain Polychaeta the bundles of setae are so extensive that they
nearly form a complete circle surrounding the body; and in the
Oligochaet genus <i>Perichaeta</i> (= <i>Pheretima</i>), and some allies, there
is actually a complete circle of setae in each segment broken only by
minute gaps, one dorsal, the other ventral.</p>

<p><i>Coelom</i>.&mdash;The Chaetopoda are characterized by a spacious coelom,
which is divided into a series of chambers in accordance with the
general metamerism of the body. This is the typical arrangement,
which is exhibited in the majority of the Polychaeta and Oligochaeta;
in these the successive chambers of the coelom are separated
by the intersegmental septa, sheets of muscle fibres extending from
the body wall to the gut and thus forming partitions across the body.
The successive cavities are not, however, completely closed from
each other; there is some communication between adjoining segments,
and the septa are sometimes deficient here and there. Thus
in the Chaetopoda the perivisceral cavity is coelomic; in this
respect the group contrasts with the Arthropoda and Molluscs,
where the perivisceral cavity is, mainly at least, part of the vascular
or haemal system, and agrees with the Vertebrata. The coelom is
lined throughout by cells, which upon the intestine become large
and loaded with excretory granules, and are known as chloragogen
cells. Several forms of cells float freely in the fluid of the coelom.
In another sense also the coelom is not a closed cavity, for it communicates
in several ways with the external medium. Thus, among
the Oligochaeta there are often a series of dorsal pores, or a single
head pore, present also among the Polychaeta (in <i>Ammochares</i>).
In these and other Chaetopods the coelom is also put into indirect
relations with the outside world by the nephridia and by the gonad
ducts. In these features, and in the fact that the gonads are local
proliferations of the coelomic epithelium, which have undergone no
further changes in the simpler forms, the coelom of this group shows
in a particularly clear fashion the general characters of the coelom
in the higher Metazoa. It has been indeed largely upon the conditions
characterizing the Chaetopoda that the conception of the
coelom in the Coelomocoela has been based.</p>

<p>Among the simpler Chaetopoda the coelom retains the character
of a series of paired chambers, showing the above relations to the
exterior and to the gonads. There are, however, further complications
in some forms. Especially are these to be seen in the
more modified Oligochaeta and in the much more modified Hirudinea.
In the Polychaeta, which are to be regarded as structurally simpler
forms than the two groups just referred to, there is but little subdivision
of the coelom of the segments, indeed a tendency in the
reverse direction, owing to the suppression of septa. Among the
Oligochaeta the dorsal vessel in <i>Dinodrilus</i> and <i>Megascolides</i> is
enclosed in a separate coelomic chamber which may or may not
communicate with the main coelomic cavity. To this pericardial
coelom is frequently added a gonocoel enclosing the gonads and the
funnels of their ducts. This condition is more fully dealt with below
in the description of the Oligochaeta. The division and, indeed,
partial suppression of the coelom culminates in the leeches, which
in this, as in some other respects, are the most modified of Annelids.</p>

<p><i>Nervous System.</i>&mdash;In all Chaetopods this system consists of
cerebral ganglia connected by a circumoesophageal commissure
with a ventral ganglionated cord. The plan of the central nervous
system is therefore that of the Arthropoda. Among the Archiannelida,
in <i>Aeolosoma</i> and some Polychaetes, the whole central nervous system
remains imbedded in the epidermis. In others, it lies in the coelom,
often surrounded by a special and occasionally rather thick sheath.
The cerebral ganglia constitute an archicerebrum for the most part,
there being no evidence that, as in the Arthropoda, a movement
forward of post-oral ganglia has taken place. In the leeches, however,
there seems to be the commencement of the formation of a syncerebrum.
In the latter, the segmentally arranged ganglia are more
sharply marked off from the connectives than in other Chaetopods,
where nerve cells exist along the whole ventral chain, though more
numerous in segmentally disposed swellings.</p>

<p><i>Vascular System.</i>&mdash;In addition to the coelom, another system of
fluid-holding spaces lies between the body wall and the gut in the
Chaetopoda. This is the vascular or haemal system (formerly and
unnecessarily termed pseudhaemal). With a few exceptions among
the Polychaeta the vascular system is always present among the
Chaetopoda, and always consists of a system of vessels with definite
walls, which rarely communicate with the coelom. It is in fact
typically a closed system. The larger trunks open into each other
either directly by cross branches, or a capillary system is formed.
There are no lacunar blood spaces with ill-defined or absent walls
except for a sinus surrounding the intestine, which is at least frequently
present. The principal trunks consist of a dorsal vessel
lying above the gut, and a ventral vessel below the gut but above the
nervous cord. These two vessels in the Oligochaeta are united in
the anterior region of the body by a smaller or greater number of
branches which surround the oesophagus and are, some of them at
least, contractile and in that case wider than the rest. The dorsal
vessel also communicates with the ventral vessel indirectly by the
intestinal sinus, which gives off branches to both the longitudinal
trunks, and by tegementary vessels and capillaries which supply the
skin and the nephridia. In the smaller and simpler forms the
capillary networks are much reduced, but the dorsal and ventral
vessels are usually present. The former, however, is frequently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page791" id="page791"></a>791</span>
developed only in the anterior region of the body where it emerges
from the peri-intestinal blood sinus. On the other hand, additional
longitudinal trunks are sometimes developed, the chief one of which
is a supra-intestinal vessel lying below the dorsal vessel and closely
adherent to the walls of the oesophagus in which region it appears.
The capillaries sometimes (in many leeches and Oligochaeta) extend
into the epidermis itself. Usually they do not extend outwards of
the muscular layers of the body wall. The main trunks of the
vascular system often possess valves at the origin of branches which
regulate the direction of the blood flow. Among many Oligochaeta
the dorsal blood-vessel is partly or entirely a double tube, which is
a retention of a character shown by F. Vezhdovský to exist in the
embryo of certain forms. The blood in the Chaetopoda consists
of a plasma in which float a few corpuscles. The plasma is coloured
red by haemoglobin: it is sometimes (in <i>Sabella</i> and a few other
Polychaeta) green, which tint is due to another respiratory pigment.
The plasma may be pink (<i>Magelona</i>) or yellow (<i>Aphrodite</i>) in which
cases the colour is owing to another pigment. In <i>Aeolosoma</i> it is
usually colourless. The vascular system is in the majority of
Chaetopods a closed system. It has been asserted (and denied) that
the cellular rod which is known as the &ldquo;Heart-body&rdquo; (<i>Herzkorper</i>),
and is to be found in the dorsal vessel of many Oligochaeta and
Polychaeta, is formed of cells which are continuous with the chloragogen
cells, thus implying the existence of apertures of communication
with the coelom. The statement has been often made and
denied, but it now seems to have been placed on a firm basis (E.S.
Goodrich), that among the Hirudinea the coelom, which is largely
broken up into narrow tubes, may be confluent with the tubes of
the vascular system. This state of affairs has no antecedent improbability
about it, since in the Vertebrata the coelom is unquestionably
confluent with the haemal system through the lymphatic
vessels. Finally, there are certain Polychaeta, <i>e g.</i> the <i>Capitellidae</i>,
in which the vascular system has vanished altogether, leaving a
coelom containing haemoglobin-impregnated corpuscles. It has
been suggested (E. Ray Lankester) that this condition has been
arrived at through some such intermediate stage as that offered by
Polychaet <i>Magelona</i>. In this worm the ventral blood-vessel is so
swollen as to occupy nearly the whole of the available coelom.
Carry the process but a little farther and the coelom disappears and
its place is taken by a blood space or haemocoel. It has been held
that the condition shown in certain leeches tend to prove that the
coelom and haemocoel are primitively one series of spaces which
have been gradually differentiated. The facts of development,
however, prove their distinctness, though those same facts do not
speak clearly as to the true nature of the blood system. One view
of the origin of the latter (largely based upon observations upon the
development of <i>Polygordius</i>) sees in the blood system a persistent
blastocoel. F. Vezhdovský has lately seen reasons for regarding
the blood system as originating entirely from the hypoblast by the
secretion of fluid, the blood, from particular intestinal cells and the
consequent formation of spaces through pressure, which become
lined with these cells.</p>

<p><i>Nephridia and Coelomoducts</i>.&mdash;The name &ldquo;Nephridium&rdquo; was
originally given by Sir E. Ray Lankester to the members of a series
of tubes, proved in some cases to be excretory in nature, which
exist typically to the number of a single pair in most of the segments
of the Chaetopod body, and open each by a ciliated orifice into the
coelom on the one hand, and by a pore on to the exterior of the
body on the other. In its earlier conception, this view embraced
as homologous organs (so far as the present group is concerned) not
only the nephridia of Oligochaeta and Hirudinea, which are obviously
closely similar, but the wide tubes with an intercellular lumen and
large funnels of certain Polychaeta, and (though with less assurance)
the gonad ducts in Oligochaeta and Hirudinea. The function of
nitrogenous excretion was not therefore a necessary part of the
view&mdash;though it may be pointed out that there are grounds for
believing that the gonad ducts are to some extent also organs of
excretion (see below). Later, the investigations of E. Meyer and
E.S. Goodrich, endorsed by Lankester, led to the opinion that under
the general morphological conception of &ldquo;nephridium&rdquo; were
included two distinct sets of organs, viz. nephridia and coelomoducts.
The former (represented by, <i>e.g.</i> the &ldquo;segmental organs&rdquo;
of <i>Lumbricus</i>) have been asserted to be &ldquo;ultimately, though not
always, actually traceable to the ectoderm&rdquo;; the latter (represented
by, <i>e.g.</i> the oviduct of <i>Lumbricus</i>) are parts of the coelomic
wall itself, which have grown out to the exterior. The nephridia, in
fact, on this view, are <i>ectodermic ingrowths</i>, the coelomoducts <i>coelomic
outgrowths</i>. The cavity of the former has nothing to do with coelom.
The cavity of the latter is coelom.</p>

<p>The embryological facts upon which this view has been based,
however, have been differently interpreted. According to C.O.
Whitman the entire nephridial system (in the leech <i>Clepsine</i>) is
formed by the differentiation of a continuous epiblastic band on
each side. The exact opposite is maintained by R.S. Bergh (for
<i>Lumbricus</i> and <i>Criodrilus</i>), whose figures show a derivation of the
entire nephridium from mesoblast, and an absence of any connexion
between successive nephridia by any continuous band, epiblastic
or mesoblastic. A midway position is taken up by Wilson, who
asserts the mesoblastic formation of the funnel, but also asserts
the presence of a continuous band of epiblast from which certainly
the terminal vesicle of the nephridium, and doubtfully the glandular
part of the tube is derived. Vezhdovský&rsquo;s figures of <i>Rhynchelmis</i>
agree with those of Bergh in showing the backward growth of the
nephridium from the funnel cell. There are thus substantial reasons
for believing that the nephridium grows backwards from a funnel
as does the coelomoduct. It is therefore by no means certain that
so profound a difference embryologically can be asserted to exist
between the excretory nephridia and the ducts leading from the
coelom to the exterior, which are usually associated with the extrusion
of the genital products among the Chaetopoda.</p>

<p>There are, however, anatomical and histological differences to be
seen at any rate at the extremes between the undoubted nephridia
of Goodrich, Meyer and Lankester, and the coelomoducts of the same
authors.</p>

<p>I. <i>Nephridia</i>.&mdash;Excretory organs which are undisputed nephridia
are practically universal among the Oligochaeta, Hirudinea and
Archiannelida, and occur in many Polychaeta. Their total absence
has been asserted definitely only in <i>Paranais littoralis</i>. Usually these
organs are present to the number of a single pair per somite, and are
commonly present in the majority of the segments of the body,
failing often among the Oligochaeta in a varying number of the
anterior segments. They are considerably reduced in number in
certain Polychaeta. Essentially, a nephridium is a tube, generally very
long and much folded upon itself, composed of a string of cells placed
end to end in which the continuous lumen is excavated. Such cells
are termed &ldquo;drain pipe&rdquo; cells. Frequently the lumen is branched
and may form a complicated anastomosing network in these cells.
Externally, the nephridium opens by a straight part of the tube,
which is often very wide, and here the intracellular lumen becomes
intercellular. Rarely the nephridium does not communicate with
the coelom; in such cases the nephridium ends in a single cell, like
the &ldquo;flame cell&rdquo; of a Platyhelminth worm, in which there is a lumen
blocked at the coelomic end by a tuft of fine cilia projecting into the
lumen. This is so with <i>Aeolosoma</i> (Vezhdovský). The condition
is interesting as a persistence of the conditions obtaining in the
provisional nephridia of <i>e.g.</i> <i>Rhynchelmis</i>, which afterwards become
by an enlargement and opening up of the funnel the permanent
nephridia of the adult worm. In some Polychaets (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Glycera</i>,
see fig. 2) there are many of these flame cells to a single nephridium
which are specialized in form, and have been termed &ldquo;solenocytes&rdquo;
(Goodrich). They are repeated in <i>Polygordius</i>, and are exactly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page792" id="page792"></a>792</span>
to be compared with similarly-placed cells in the nephridia of
<i>Amphioxus</i>.</p>

<p>More usually, and indeed in nearly every other case among the
Oligochaeta and Hirudinea, the coelomic aperture of the nephridium
consists of several cells, ciliated like the nephridium itself for a greater
or less extent, forming a funnel. The funnel varies greatly in size
and number of its component cells. There are so many differences
of detail that no line can be drawn between the one-celled funnel
of <i>Aeolosoma</i> and the extraordinarily large and folded funnel of the
posterior nephridia in the Oligochaete <i>Thamnodrilus</i>. In the last-mentioned
worm the funnels of the anterior nephridia are small and
but few celled; it is only the nephridia in and behind the 17th
segment of the body which are particularly large and with a sinuous
margin, which recall the funnels of the gonad ducts (<i>i.e.</i> coelomoducts).</p>

<p>Among the Polychaeta the nephridium of <i>Nereis</i> (see fig. 2) is like
that of the Oligochaeta and Hirudinea in that the coiled glandular
tube has an intracellular duct which is ciliated in the same way in
parts. The Polychaeta, however, present us with another form
of nephridium seen, for example, in <i>Arenicola</i>, where a large funnel
leads into a short and wide excretory tube whose lumen is intercellular.
In the young stages of this worm which have been investigated
by W.B. Benham, the tube, though smaller, and with a
but little pronounced funnel, has still an intercellular duct. That
these organs in Polychaeta serve for the removal of the generative
products to the exterior is proved not only by the correspondence
in number to them of the gonads, but by actual observation of the
generative products in transit. This form of nephridia leads to the
shorter but essentially similar organs in the Polychaete <i>Sternaspis</i>,
and to those of the Echiuroidea (<i>q.v.</i>) and of the Gephyrea (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p>Though the paired arrangement of the nephridia is the prevalent
one in the Chaetopoda, there are many examples, among the Oligochaeta,
of species and genera in which there are several, even many,
nephridia in each segment of the body, which may or may not be
connected among themselves, but have in any case separate orifices
on to the exterior.</p>

<p>2. <i>Coelomoducis.</i>&mdash;In this category are included (by Goodrich
and Lankester) the gonad ducts of the Oligochaeta, certain funnels
without any aperture to the exterior that have been detected in
<i>Nereis</i>, &amp;c., funnels with wide and short ducts attached to nephridia
in other Polychaeta, gonad ducts in the <i>Capitellidae</i>, the gonad
ducts of the leeches. In all these cases we have a duct which has
a usually wide, always intercellular, lumen, generally, if not
always, ciliated, which opens directly into the coelom on the one
hand and on to the exterior of the body on the other. These characters
are plain in all the cases cited, excepting only the leeches
which will be considered separately.</p>

<p>There is not a great deal of difference between most of these
structures and true nephridia. It is not clear, for example, to which
category it is necessary to refer the excretory organs of <i>Arenicola</i>,
or <i>Polynoe</i>. Both series of organs consist essentially of a ciliated
tube leading from the coelom to the exterior. Both series of organs
grow back centrifugally from the funnel. In both the cavity originally
or immediately continuous with the coelom appears first in the
funnel and grows backwards. In some cases, <i>e.g.</i> oviducts of Oligochaeta,
sperm ducts of <i>Phreoryctes</i>, the coelomoducts occupy, like
the nephridia, two segments, the funnel opening into that in front
of the segment which carries the external pore. It is by no means
certain that a hard and fast line can be drawn between intra- and
intercellular lumina. Finally, in function there are some points of likeness.
The gonad ducts of <i>Lumbricus</i>, &amp;c., must perform one function
of nephridia; they must convey to the exterior some of the coelomic
fluid with its disintegrated products of waste. There is no possibility
that sperm and ova can escape by these tubes not in company
with coelomic fluid. In the case of many Oligochaeta where there
is no vascular network surrounding the nephridium, this function
must be the chief one of those glands, the more elaborate process
of excretion taking place in the case of nephridia surrounded by a
rich plexus of blood capillaries. A consideration of the mode of
development and appearance of the coelomoducts that have thus
far been enumerated (with the possible exception of those of the
leeches) seems to show that there is a distinct though varying relation
between them and the nephridia. It has been shown that in <i>Tubifex</i>,
and some other aquatic Oligochaeta, the genital segments are at first
provided with nephridia, and that these disappear on the appearance
of the generative ducts, which are coelomoducts. In <i>Lumbricus</i>
the connexion is a little closer; the funnel of the nephridium, in the
segments in which the funnels of the gonad ducts are to be developed,
persists and is continuous with the gonad duct funnels on their first
appearance. In the development of the Acanthodrilid earthworm
<i>Octochaetus</i> (F.E. Beddard) the funnels of the pronephridia disappear
except in the genital segments, where they seem to be actually
converted into the genital funnels. At the least there is no doubt
that the genital funnels are developed precisely where the nephridial
funnels formerly existed. If the genital funnels are not wholly or
partly formed out of the nephridial funnels they have replaced them.
In the genital segments of <i>Eudrilus</i> the nephridia are present, but
the funnels have not been found though they are obvious in other
segments. Here also the genital funnels have either replaced or
been formed out of nephridial funnels. In <i>Haplotaxis heterogyne</i>
(W.B. Benham) the sperm ducts are hardly to be distinguished from
nephridia; they are sinuous tubes with an intra-cellular duct. But
the funnel is large and thus differs from the funnels of the nephridia
in adjoining segments. Here again the nephridial funnel seems to
have been converted into or certainly replaced by a secondarily
developed funnel. This example is similar to cases among the Polychaeta
where a true nephridium is provided with a large funnel,
coelomostome, according to the nomenclature of Lankester. The
whole organ, having, as is thought but not known, this double origin,
is termed a nephromixium. The various facts, however, seem to be
susceptible of another interpretation. It may be pointed out that
the several examples described recall a phenomenon which is not
uncommon and is well known to anatomists. That is the replacement
of an organ by, sometimes coupled with its partial conversion
into, a similar or slightly different organ performing the same or an
analogous function. Thus the postcaval vein of the higher vertebrata
is partly a new structure altogether, and is partly formed out
of the pre-existing posterior cardinals. The more complete replacements,
such as the nephridia of the genital segment of <i>Tubifex</i> by
a subsequently formed genital duct, may be compared with the
succession of the nesonephros to the pronephros in vertebrates, and
of the metanephros to the mesonephros in the higher vertebrates.
It might be well to term these structures, mostly serving as gonad
ducts, which have an undoubted resemblance to nephridia, and for
the most part an undoubted connexion with nephridia, &ldquo;Nephrodinia,&rdquo;
to distinguish them from another category of &ldquo;ducts&rdquo;
which are communications between the coelom and the exterior,
and which have no relation whatever to nephridia or to the organs
just discussed. For these latter, the term coelomoducts might
well be reserved. To this category belong certain sacs and pouches
in many, perhaps most, genera of the Oligochaeta family, <i>Eudrilidae</i>,
and possibly the gonad ducts in the Hirudinea. As an example of
the former it has been shown (Beddard) that a large median sac in
<i>Lybiodrilus</i> is at first freely open to the coelom, that it later becomes
shut off from the same, that it then acquires an external orifice, and,
finally, that it encloses the ovary or ovaries, between which and the
exterior a passage is thus effected. To this category will belong the
oviducts in Teleostean fishes and probably the gonad ducts in several
groups of invertebrates.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="sc">Polychaeta</span>.&mdash;This group may be thus defined and the
definition contrasted and compared with those of the other
divisions of the Chaetopoda. Setae always present and often
very large, much varied in form and very numerous, borne by
the dorsal and ventral parapodia (when present). The prostomium
and the segments generally often bear processes sensory
and branchial. Eyes often present and comparatively complicated
in structure. Clitellum not present as a definite organ,
as in Oligochaeta. The anus is mostly terminal, and there are
no anterior and posterior suckers. Nervous system often
imbedded in the epidermis. Vascular system generally present
forming a closed system of tubes. Alimentary canal rarely
coiled, occasionally with glands which are simple caeca and
sometimes serve as air reservoirs; jaws often present and an
eversible pharynx. Nephridia sometimes of the type of those
of the Oligochaeta; in other cases short, wide tubes with a large
funnel serving also entirely or in part as gonad ducts. Frequently
reduced in number of pairs; rarely (<i>Capitellidae</i>) more
than one pair per segment. Gonads not so restricted in position
as in Oligochaets, and often more abundant; the individuals
usually unisexual. No specialized system of spermathecae,
sperm reservoirs, and copulatory apparatus, as in Oligochaeta;
development generally through a larval form; reproduction by
budding also occurs. Marine (rarely fresh-water) in habit.</p>

<p>The Polychaeta contrast with the Oligochaeta by the great
variety of outward form and by the frequency of specialization
of different regions of the body. The head is always recognizable
and much more conspicuous than in other Chaetopoda. As in
the Oligochaeta the peristomial segment is often without setae,
but this character is not by any means so constant as in the
Oligochaeta. The prostomium bears often processes, both
dorsal and ventral, which in the Sabellids are split into the circle
of branchial plumes, which surround or nearly surround the
mouth in those tube-dwelling Annelids. <i>Tomopteris</i> is remarkable
for the fact that the hammer-shaped prostomium has paired
ventral processes each with a single seta. It is held, however,
that these are a pair of parapodia which have shifted forwards.
The presence of parapodia distinguish this from other groups
of Chaetopoda. Typically, the parapodium consists of two
processes of the body on each side, each of which bears a bundle
of setae; these two divisions of the &ldquo;limb&rdquo; are termed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page793" id="page793"></a>793</span>
respectively notopodium and neuropodium. The notopodium may
be rudimentary or absent and the entire parapodium reduced to
the merest ridge or even completely unrepresented. Naturally,
it is among the free living forms that the parapodium is best
developed, and least developed among the tubicolous
Polychaeta. To each division of the parapodium
belongs typically a long tentacle, the cirrus, which
may be defective upon one or other of the notopodium
or neuropodium, and may be developed into
an arborescent gill or into a flat scale-like process,
the elytron (in <i>Polynoe</i>, &amp;c.). There are other gills
developed in addition to those which represent the
cirri.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Setae</i>.&mdash;The setae of the Polychaeta are disposed in
two bundles in many genera, but in only one bundle in
such forms as have no notopodium (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Syllis</i>). In
some genera the setae are in vertical rows, and in certain
<i>Capitellidae</i> these rows so
nearly meet that an arrangement
occurs reminiscent of
the continuous circle of setae
in the perichaetous Oligochaeta.
The setae vary much
in form and are often longer
and stronger than in the Oligochaetes.
Jointed setae and
very short hooks or &ldquo;uncini&rdquo;
(see fig. 3) are among the most
remarkable forms. Simple
bifid setae, such as those of
Oligochaetes, are also present
in certain forms.</p>

<p>Among the burrowing and
tubicolous forms it is not uncommon for the body to be distinguishable
into two or more regions; a &ldquo;thorax,&rdquo; for example, is sharply
marked off from an &ldquo;abdomen&rdquo; in the Sabellids. In these forms
the bundles of setae are either capilliform or uncinate, and the dorsal
setae of the thorax are like the ventral setae of the abdomen. It is
a remarkable and newly-ascertained fact that in regeneration (in
<i>Potamilla</i>) the thorax is not replaced by the growth of uninjured
thoracic segments; but that the anterior segments of the abdomen
take on the same characters, the setae dropping out and being
replaced in accordance with the plan of the setae in the thorax of
uninjured worms. Among the Oligochaeta the sexually mature
worm is distinguished from the immature worm by the clitellum
and by the development of genital setae. Among the Polychaeta
the sexual worm is often more marked from the asexual form, so
much so that these latter have been placed in different species or
even genera. The alteration in form does not only affect structures
used in generation; but the form of the parapodia, &amp;c., alter.
There are even dimorphic forms among the Syllids where the sexes
are, as in many Polychaets, separate.</p>

<p><i>Nephridia</i>.&mdash;The nephridia of the Polychaeta have been generally
dealt with above in considering the nephridial system of the Chaetopoda
as a whole. They contrast with those of the Oligochaeta and
Hirudinea by reason of their frequently close association with the
gonads, the same organ sometimes serving the two functions of
excretion and conveyance of the ova and spermatozoa out of the
body. On the hypothesis that such a form as <i>Dinophilus</i> (see
Haplodrili) has preserved the characters of the primitive Chaetopod
more nearly than any existing Polychaet or Oligochaet, it is clear
that the nephridia in the Oligochaeta have preserved the original
features of those organs more nearly than most Polychaeta. Thus
<i>Nereis</i> among the latter worms, from the resemblance which its
excretory system bears to that of the Oligochaeta, may be made the
starting-point of a series. In this worm the paired nephridia exist
in most of the segments of the body, and their form (see fig. 2) is much
like that of the nephridia in the <i>Enchytraeidae</i>. The funnel, which
is not large, appears to open, as a rule at least, into the segment in
front of that which bears the external orifice. Quite independent
of these are certain large dorsally situate funnel-like folds of the
coelomic epithelium, ciliated, but of which no duct has been discovered
leading to the exterior. It is possible that we have here
gonad ducts distinct from nephridia which at the time of sexual
maturity do open on to the exterior.</p>

<p>In <i>Polynoe</i> the nephridia are short tubes with a slightly folded
funnel whose lumen is intercellular, and this intercellular lumen
is characteristic of the Polychaetes as contrasted with leeches and
Oligochaetes. Among the Terebelloidea there is a remarkable
differentiation of the nephridia into two series. One set lies in front
of the diaphragm, which is the most anterior and complete septum,
the rest having disappeared or being much less developed. The
anterior nephridia, of which there are one to three pairs, contrast
with the posterior series by their small funnels and large size, the
posterior nephridia having a large funnel followed by a short tube.
In <i>Chaetozone setosa</i> the anterior nephridia occupy five segments.
There is usually a gap between the two series, several segments being
without nephridia. It seems that the posterior nephridia are mainly
gonad ducts, and the gonads are developed in close association with
the funnels. The same arrangement is found in some other Polychaetes;
for instance, in <i>Sabellaria</i> there is a single pair of large
anterior nephridia, which open by a common pore, followed after an
interval by large-funnelled and short nephridia. This differentiation
is not, however, peculiar to the Polychaetes; for in several Oligochaetes
the anterior nephridia are of large size, and opening as they
do into the buccal cavity clearly play a different function to those
which follow. In <i>Thamnodrilus</i>, as has been pointed out, there are
two series of nephridia which resemble those of the Terebelloidea
in the different sizes of their funnels. In <i>Lanice conchilega</i> the
posterior series of nephridia are connected by a thick longitudinal
duct, which seems to be seen in its most reduced form in <i>Owenia</i>,
where a duct on each side runs in the epidermis, being in parts a
groove, and receives one short tubular nephridium only and occupies
only one segment. This connexion of successive nephridia (in
<i>Lanice</i>) has its counterpart in <i>Allolobophora, Lybiodrilus</i>, and
apparently in the Lumbriculids <i>Teleuscolex</i> and <i>Styloscolex</i>, among
the Oligochaeta. Among the <i>Capitellidae</i>, which in several respects
resemble the Oligochaeta, wide and short gonad ducts coexist in
the same segments with nephridia, the latter being narrower and
longer. It is noteworthy that in this family only among the Polychaeta,
the nephridia are not restricted to a single pair in each segment;
so that the older view that the gonad ducts are metamorphosed
nephridia is not at variance with the anatomical facts
which have been just stated.</p>

<p><i>Alimentary Canal.</i>&mdash;The alimentary canal of Polychaetes is usually
a straight tube running from the anterior mouth to the posterior
anus. But in some forms, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Sternaspis</i>, the gut is coiled. In others,
again, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Cobangia</i>, the anus is anterior and ventral. A gizzard is
present in a few forms. The buccal cavity is sometimes armed with
jaws. The oesophagus is provided often with caeca which in Syllids
and <i>Hesionidae</i> have been found to contain air, and possibly therefore
perform the function of the fish&rsquo;s air-bladder. In other Polychaetes
one or more pairs of similar outgrowths are glandular. The intestine
is provided with numerous branched caeca in <i>Aphrodite</i>.</p>

<p><i>Reproduction.</i>&mdash;As is the case with the Oligochaeta, the Polychaeta
furnish examples of species which multiply asexually by
budding. There is
a further resemblance
between the
two orders of Chaetopoda
in that this
budding is not a
general phenomenon,
but confined
to a few forms
only. Budding, in
fact, among the
Polychaetes is
limited to the
family <i>Syllidae</i>. In
the Oligochaetes
it is only the
families <i>Aeolosomatidae</i>
and <i>Naididae</i>
that show
the same phenomenon. It has been mentioned
that in the Nereids a sexual form
occurs which differs structurally from the
asexual worms, and was originally placed in
a separate genus, <i>Heteronereis</i>; hence the
name &ldquo;Heteronereid&rdquo; for the sexual worm.
In <i>Syllis</i> there is also a &ldquo;Heterosyllid&rdquo; form
in which the gonads are limited to a posterior
region of the body which is further marked
off from the anterior non-sexual segments
by the oak-like setae. In some Syllids this
posterior region separates off from the rest,
producing a new head; thus a process of
fission occurs which has been termed schizogamy.
A similar life history distinguishes
certain Sabellid worms, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Filigrana</i>. Among
the Syllids this simple state of affairs is
further complicated. In <i>Autolytus</i> there is,
to begin with, a conversion of the posterior
half of the body to form a sexual zooid. But
before this separates off a number of other
zooids are formed from a zone of budding
which appears between the two first-formed
individuals. Ultimately, a chain of sexual
zooids is thus formed. A given stock only
produces zooids of one sex. In <i>Myrianida</i> there is a further
development of this process. The conversion of the posterior
end of the simple individual into a sexual region is dispensed
with; but from a preanal budding segment a series of sexual buds
are produced. The well-known Syllid, discovered during the voyage
of the &ldquo;Challenger,&rdquo; shows a modification of this form of budding.
Here, however, the buds are lateral, though produced from a budding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page794" id="page794"></a>794</span>
zone, and they themselves produce other buds, so that a ramifying
colony is created.</p>

<p class="pt2">Quite recently, another mode of budding has been described in
<i>Trypanosyllis gemmipara</i>, where a crowd of some fifty buds arising
symmetrically are produced at the tail end of the worm. In some
Syllids, such as <i>Pionosyllis gestans</i>, the ova are attached to the body
of the parent in a regular line, and develop in situ; this process,
which has been attributed to budding, is an &ldquo;external gestation,&rdquo;
and occurs in a number of species.</p>

<p class="pt2">As is very frequently the case with marine forms, as compared
with their fresh-water and terrestrial allies, the Polychaeta differ
from the Oligochaeta and Hirudinea in possessing a free living
larval form which is hatched at an early stage in development.
This larva is termed the Trochosphere larva, and typically (as it is
held) is an egg-shaped larva with two bands of cilia, one preoral and
one postoral, with an apical nervous plate surmounted by a tuft of
longer cilia, and with a simple bent alimentary canal, with lateral
mouth and posterior anus, between which and the ectoderm is a
spacious cavity (blastocoel) traversed by muscular strands and often
containing a larval kidney. The segmentation is of the mesoblast
to begin with, and appears later behind the mouth, the part anterior
to this becoming the prostomium of the adult. The chief modifications
of this form are seen in the <i>Mitraria</i>
larva of <i>Ammochares</i> with only the preoral band,
which is much folded and which has provisional
and long setae; the atrochous larva, where the
covering of cilia is uniform and not split into
bands; and the polytrochous larva where there
are several bands surrounding the body. There
are also other modifications.</p>

<p><i>Classification</i>.&mdash;The older arrangement of the
Polychaeta into Errantia or free living and
Tubicola or tube-dwelling forms will hardly fit
the much increased knowledge of the group.
W.B. Benham&rsquo;s division into Phanerocephala
in which the prostomium is plain, and Crytocephala
in which the prostomium is hidden by
the peristomium adopted by Sedgwick, can only
be justified by the character used; for the Terebellids,
though phanerocephalous, have many
of the features of the Sabellids. It is perhaps
safer to subdivide the Order into 6 Suborders
(in the number of these following Benham, except
in combining the Sabelliformia and Hermelliformia).
Of these 6, the two first to be considered
are very plainly separable and represent
the extremes of Polychaete organization, (1)
<i>Nereidiformia</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Errant&rdquo; Polychaetes with
well-marked prostomium possessing tentacles
and palps with evident and locomotor parapodia,
supported (with few exceptions) by strong
spines, the aciculi; muscular pharynx usually
armed with jaws; septa and nephridia regularly
metameric and similar throughout body;
free living and predaceous. (2) <i>Cryptocephala</i>.&mdash;Tube-dwelling
with body divided into thorax
and abdomen marked by the setae, which are
reversed in position in the neuropodium and
notopodium respectively in the two regions.
Parapodia hardly projecting; palps of prosomium
forming branched gills; no pharynx or
eversible buccal region; no septa in thorax,
septa in abdomen regularly disposed. Nephridia
in two series; large, anterior nephridia followed
by small, short tubes in abdomen. The remaining
groups are harder to define, with the exception
of the (3) <i>Capitelliformia</i>, which are mud-living
worms of an &ldquo;oligochaetous&rdquo; appearance, and
with some affinities to that order. The peristomium has no setae, and
the setae generally are hair-like or uncinate, often forming almost complete
rings. The genital ducts are limited to one segment (the 8th in
<i>Capitella capitata</i>), and there are genital setae on this and the next
segment. In other forms genital ducts and nephridia coexist in the
same segment. The nephridia are sometimes numerous in each segment.
There is no blood system, and the coelomic corpuscles contain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page795" id="page795"></a>795</span>
haemoglobin. (4) <i>Terebelliformia</i>. These worms are in some
respects like the Sabellids (Cryptocephala). The parapodia, as in
the Capitellidae, are hardly developed. The buccal region is unarmed
and not eversible. The prostomium has many long filaments
which recall the gills of the Sabellids, &amp;c. The nephridia are specialized
into two series, as in the last-mentioned worms. (5) <i>Spioniformia</i>
(including <i>Chaetopterus</i>, <i>Spio</i>, &amp;c.) and (6) <i>Scoleciformia</i>
(<i>Arenicola</i>, <i>Chloraema</i>, <i>Sternaspis</i>) are the remaining groups. In
both, the nephridia are all alike; there are no jaws; the prostomium
rarely has processes. The body is often divisible into
regions.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Oligochaeta</span>.&mdash;As contrasted with the other subdivisions
of the Chaetopoda, the Oligochaeta may be thus defined. Setae
very rarely absent (genus
<i>Achaeta</i>) and as a rule not
so large or so numerous in
each segment as in the
Polychaeta, and different
in shape. Eyes rarely
present and then rudimentary.
Prostomium generally
small, sometimes prolonged,
but never bearing
tentacles or processes.
Appendages of body reduced
to branchiae, present
only in four species, and
to the ventral copulatory
appendages of <i>Alma</i> and
<i>Criodrilus</i>. Clitellum
always present, extending
over two (many limicolous
forms) to forty-five segments
(<i>Alma</i>). Segments
of body numerous and not
distinctive of species, being
irregular and not fixed in
numbers. In terrestrial
forms dorsal pores are usually
present; in aquatic
forms a head pore only.
Anus nearly always terminal,
rarely dorsal, at a
little distance from end
of body. Suckers absent.
Nervous system rarely
(<i>Aeolosoma</i>) in continuity
with epidermis. Vascular
system always present,
forming a closed system,
more complicated in the
larger forms than in the
aquatic genera. Several
specially large contractile
trunks in the anterior segments uniting the dorsal and ventral
vessels. Nephridia generally paired, often very numerous in each
segment, in the form of long, much-coiled tubes with intracellular
lumen. Gonads limited in number of pairs, testes and ovaries
always present in the same individual. Special sacs developed
from the intersegmental septa lodge the developing ova and
sperm. Special gonad ducts always present. Male ducts often
open on to exterior through a terminal chamber which is
variously specialized, and sometimes with a penis.</p>

<p>Generative pores usually paired, sometimes single and median.
Spermathecae nearly always present. Alimentary canal straight,
often with appended glands of complicated or simpler structure;
no jaws. Eggs deposited in a cocoon after copulation. Development
direct. Reproduction by budding also occurs. Fresh-water
(rarely marine) and terrestrial.</p>

<p>The Oligochaeta show a greater variety of size than any other
group of the Chaetopoda. They range from a millimetre or
so (smaller species of <i>Aeolosoma</i>) to 6 ft. or even rather more
(<i>Microchaeta rappi</i>, &amp;c.) in length.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Setae.</i>&mdash;The setae, which are always absent from the peristomial
segment, are also sometimes absent from a greater number of the
anterior segments of the body, and have completely disappeared in
<i>Achaeta cameranoi.</i> When present they are either arranged in four
bundles of from one to ten or even more setae, or are disposed in continuous
lines completely encircling each segment of the body. This
latter arrangement characterizes many genera of the family <i>Megascolicidae</i>
and one genus (<i>Periscolex</i>) of the <i>Glossoscolicidae.</i> It has
been shown (Bourne) that the &ldquo;perichaetous&rdquo; condition is probably
secondary, inasmuch as in worms which are, when adult,
&ldquo;perichaetous&rdquo; the setae develop in pairs so that the embryo
passes through a stage in which it has four bundles of setae, two
to each bundle, the prevalent condition in the group. Rarely there
is an irregular disposition of the setae which are not paired, though
the total number is eight to a segment (fig. 10), <i>e.g.</i> <i>Pontoscolex.</i>
The varying forms of the setae are illustrated in fig. 11.</p>

<p><i>Structure.</i>&mdash;The body wall consists of an epidermis which secretes
a delicate cuticle and is only ciliated in <i>Aeolosoma</i>, and in that genus
only on the under surface of the prostomium. The epidermis contains
numerous groups of sense cells; beneath the epidermis there
is rarely (<i>Kynotus</i>) an extensive connective tissue dermis. Usually
the epidermis is immediately followed by the circular layer of muscles,
and this by the longitudinal coat. Beneath this again is a distinct
peritoneum lining the coelom, which appears to be wanting as a
special layer in some Polychaetes (Benham, Gilson). The muscular
layers are thinner in the aquatic forms, which possess only a single
row of longitudinal fibres, or (<i>Enchytracidae</i>) two layers. In the
earthworms, on the other hand, this coat is thick and composed of
many layers.</p>

<p>The clitellum consists of a thickening of the epidermis, and is of
two forms among the Oligochaeta. In the aquatic genera the
epidermis comes to consist entirely of glandular cells, which are,
however, arranged in a single layer. In the earthworms, on the other
hand, the epidermis becomes specialized into several layers of cells,
all of which are glandular. It is therefore obviously much thicker
than the clitellum in the limicolous forms. The position of the
clitellum, which is universal in occurrence, varies much as does the
number of component segments. As a rule&mdash;to which, however,
there are exceptions&mdash;the clitellum consists of two or three segments
only in the small aquatic Oligochaeta, while in the terrestrial forms
it is as a general rule, to which again there are exceptions, a more
extensive, sometimes much more extensive, region.</p>

<p>In the Oligochaeta there is a closer correspondence between external
metamerism and the divisions of the coelom than is apparent
in some Chaetopods. The external segments are usually definable
by the setae; and if the setae are absent, as in the anterior segments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page796" id="page796"></a>796</span>
of several <i>Geoscolicidae</i>, the nephridiopores indicate the segments;
to each segment corresponds internally a chamber of the coelom
which is separated from adjacent segments by transverse septa, which
are only unrecognizable in the genus <i>Aeolosoma</i> and in the head
region of other Oligochaeta. In the latter case, the numerous bands
of muscle attaching the pharynx to the parietes have obliterated the
regular partition by means of septa.</p>

<p><i>Nephridia</i>.&mdash;The nephridia in this group are invariably coiled tubes
with an intracellular lumen and nearly invariably open into the
coelom by a funnel. There are no renal organs with a wide intercellular
lumen, such as occur in the Polychaeta, nor is there ever any
permanent association between nephridia and ducts connected with
the evacuation of the generative products, such as occur in <i>Alciope</i>,
<i>Saccocirrus</i>, &amp;c. In these points the Oligochaeta agree with the
Hirudinea. They also agree in the general structure of the nephridia.
It has been ascertained that the nephridia of Oligochaeta are preceded
in the embryo by a pair of delicate and sinuous tubes, also found in
the Hirudinea and Polychaeta, which are larval excretory organs.
It is not quite certain whether these are to be regarded as the remnant
of an earlier excretory system, replaced among the Oligochaeta by
the subsequently developed paired structures, or whether these
&ldquo;head kidneys&rdquo; are the first pair of nephridia precociously developed.
The former view has been extensively held, and it is
supported by the fact that in <i>Octochaetus</i> the first segment of the
body has a pair of nephridia which is exactly like those which follow,
and, like them, persists. On the other hand, in most Oligochaeta the
first segment has in the adult no nephridium, and in the case of
<i>Octochaetus</i> the existence of a &ldquo;head kidney&rdquo; antedating the subsequently
developed nephridia of the first and other segments has
neither been seen nor proved to be absent. In any case the nephridia
which occupy the segments of the body generally are first of all
represented by paired structures, the &ldquo;pronephridia,&rdquo; in which the
funnel is composed of but one cell, which is flagellate. This stage
has at any rate been observed in <i>Rhynchelmis</i> and <i>Lumbricus</i> (in
its widest sense) by Vezhdovský. It is further noticeable that in
<i>Rhynchelmis</i> the covering of vesicular cells which clothes the drain-pipe
cells of the adult nephridium is cut off from the nephridial
cells themselves and is not a peritoneal layer surrounding the
nephridium. Thus the nephridia, in this case at least, are a part
of the coelom and are not shut off from it by a layer of peritoneum,
as are other organs which lie in it, <i>e.g.</i> the gut. A growth both of
the funnel, which becomes multicellular, and of the rest of the nephridium
produces the adult nephridia of the genera mentioned. The
paired disposition of these organs is the prevalent one among the
Oligochaeta, and occurs in all of twelve out of the thirteen families
into which the group is divided.</p>

<p>Among the <i>Megascolicidae</i>, however, which in number of genera
and species nearly equals the remaining families taken together,
another form of the excretory system occurs. In the genera <i>Pheretima,
Megascolex</i>, <i>Dichogaster</i>, &amp;c., each segment contains a large
number of nephridia, which, on account of the fact that they are
necessarily smaller than the paired nephridia of <i>e.g.</i> <i>Lumbricus</i>, have
been termed micronephridia, as opposed to meganephridia; there is,
however, no essential difference in structure, though micronephridia
are not uncommonly (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Megascolides</i>, <i>Octochaetus</i>) unprovided
with funnels. It is disputed whether these micronephridia are or
are not connected together in each segment and from segment to
segment. In any case they have been shown in three genera to develop
by the growth and splitting into a series of original paired
pronephridia. A complex network, however, does occur in <i>Lybiodrilus</i>
and certain other <i>Eudrilidae</i>, where the paired nephridia
possess ducts leading to the exterior which ramify and anastomose
on the thickness of the body wall. The network is, however, of the
duct of the nephridium, possibly ectodermic in origin, and does not
affect the glandular tubes which remain undivided and with one
coelomic funnel each.</p>

<p>The Oligochaeta are the only Chaetopods in which undoubted
nephridia may possess a relationship with the alimentary canal.
Thus, in <i>Octochaetus multiporus</i> a large nephridium opens anteriorly
into the buccal cavity, and numerous nephridia in the same worm
evacuate their contents into the rectum. The anteriorly-opening
and usually very large nephridia are not uncommon, and have
been termed &ldquo;peptonephridia.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Gonads and Gonad Ducts</i>.&mdash;The Oligochaeta agree with the leeches
and differ from most Polychaeta in that they are hermaphrodite.
There is no exception to this generalization. The gonads are, moreover,
limited and fixed in numbers, and are practically invariably
attached to the intersegmental septa, usually to the front septum
of a segment, more rarely to the posterior septum. The prevalent
number of testes is one pair in the aquatic genera and two pairs in
earthworms. But there are exceptions; thus a species of <i>Lamprodrilus</i>
has four pairs of testes. The ovaries are more usually one
pair, but two are sometimes present. The segments occupied by
the gonads are fixed, and are for earthworms invariably X, XI, or one
of them for the testes, and XIII for the ovaries The position
varies in the aquatic Oligochaeta. The Oligochaeta contrast with
the Polychaeta in the general presence of outgrowths of the septa
in the genital segments, which are either close to, or actually involve,
the gonads, and into which may also open the funnels of the gonad
ducts. These sacs contain the developing sperm cells or eggs, and
are with very few exceptions universal in the group. The testes
are more commonly thus involved than are the ovaries. It is indeed
only among the <i>Eudrilidae</i> that the enclosure of the ovaries in septal
sacs is at all general. Recently the same thing has been recorded in
a few species of <i>Pheretima</i> (= <i>Perichaeta</i>), but details are as yet
wanting. We can thus speak in these worms of <i>gonocoels</i>, <i>i.e.</i>
coelomic cavities connected only with the generative system. These
cavities communicate with the exterior through the gonad ducts,
which have nothing to do with them, but whose coelomic funnels are
taken up by them in the course of their growth. There are, however,
in the <i>Eudrilidae</i>, as already mentioned, sacs envolving the ovaries
which bore their own way to the exterior, and thus may be termed
coelomoducts. These sacs are dealt with later under the description
of the spermathecae, which function they appear to perform. The
gonad ducts are male and female, and open opposite to or, rarely,
alongside of the gonads, whose products they convey to the exterior.
The oviducts are always short trumpet-shaped tubes and are sometimes
reduced (<i>Enchytraeidae</i>) to merely the external orifices. It
is possible, however, that those oviducts belong to a separate morphological
category, more comparable to the dorsal pores and to
abdominal pores in some fishes. The sperm ducts are usually longer
than the oviducts; but in Limicolae both series of tubes opening
by the funnel into one segment and on to the exterior in the following
segment. While the oviducts always open directly on to the exterior,
it is the rule for the sperm ducts to open on to the exterior
near to or through certain
terminal chambers, which
have been variously
termed atrium and prostate,
or spermiducal
gland. The distal extremity
of this apparatus
is sometimes eversible as
a penis. Associated with
these glands are frequently
to be found bundles or
pairs of long and variously
modified setae which are
termed penial setae, to distinguish
them from other
setae sometimes but not
always associated with
rather similar glands which
are found anteriorly to
these, and often in the
immediate neighbourhood
of the spermathecae; the
latter are spoken of as
genital setae.</p>

<p><i>Spermathecae.</i>&mdash;These
structures appear to be
absolutely distinctive of
the Oligochaeta, unless
the sacs which contain
sperm and open in common
with the nephridia of <i>Saccocirrus</i>
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Haplodrili</a></span>)
are similar. Spermathecae
are generally present in
the Oligochaeta and are absent only in comparatively few genera and
species. Their position varies, but is constant for the species, and
they are rarely found behind the gonads. They are essentially
spherical, pear-shaped or oval sacs opening on to the exterior but
closed at the coelomic end. In a few <i>Enchytraeidae</i> and <i>Lumbriculidae</i>
the spermathecae open at the distal extremity into the
oesophagus, which is a fact difficult of explanation. Among the
aquatic Oligochaeta and many earthworms (the families <i>Lunibricidae</i>,
<i>Geoscolicidae</i> and a few other genera) the spermathecae are
simple structures, as has been described. In the majority of the
<i>Megascolicidae</i> each sac is provided with one or more diverticula,
tubular or oval in form, of a slightly different histological character
in the lining epithelium, and in them is invariably lodged the sperm.</p>

<p>The spermathecae are usually paired structures, one pair to each
of the segments where they occur. In many <i>Geoscolicidae</i>, however,
and certain <i>Lumbricidae</i> and <i>Perichaetidae</i>, there are several, even
a large number, of pairs of very small spermathecae to each of the
segments which contain them.</p>

<p>In the <i>Eudrilidae</i> there are spermathecae of different morphological
value. In figs. 12 and 13 are shown the spermathecae of the
genera <i>Hyperiodrilus</i> and <i>Heliodrilus</i>, which are simple sacs ending
blindly as in other earthworms, but of which there is only one median
opening in the thirteenth segment or in the eleventh. In <i>Heliodrilus</i>
the blind extremity of the spermatheca is enclosed in a coelomic sac
which is in connexion with the sacs envolving the ovaries and oviducts.
In <i>Hyperiodrilus</i> the whole spermatheca is thus included
in a corresponding sac, which is of great extent. In such other
genera of the family as have been examined, the true spermatheca
has entirely disappeared, and the sac which contains it in <i>Hyperiodrilus</i>
alone remains. This sac has been already referred to as a
coelomoduct. Its orifice on to the exterior is formed by an involution
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page797" id="page797"></a>797</span>
(as it appears) of the epidermis, and that it performs the function
of a spermatheca is shown by its containing spermatozoa, or, in
<i>Stuhlmannia</i>, a spermatophore. In <i>Polytoreutus</i>, also, spermatophores
have been found in these spermathecal sacs. We have thus
the replacement of a spermatheca, corresponding to those of the
remaining families of Oligochaeta, and derived, as is believed, from
the epidermis, by a structure performing the same function, but
derived from the mesoblastic tissues, and with a cavity which is
coelom.</p>

<p><i>Alimentary Canal.</i>&mdash;The alimentary canal is always a straight tube,
and the anus, save in the genera <i>Criodrilus</i> and <i>Dero</i>, is completely
terminal. A buccal cavity, a pharynx, an oesophagus and an
intestine are always distinguishable. Commonly among the terrestrial
forms there is a gizzard, or two gizzards, or a larger number,
in the oesophageal region. There is no armed protrusible pharynx,
such as exists in some other Chaetopods. This may be associated
with mud-eating habits; but it is not wholly certain that this is the
case; for in <i>Chaetogaster</i> and <i>Agriodrilus</i>, which are predaceous
worms, there is no protrusible pharynx, though in the latter the
oesophagus is thickened through its extent with muscular fibres.
The oesophagus is often furnished with glandular diverticula, the
&ldquo;glands of Morren,&rdquo; which are often of complex structure through
the folding of their walls. Among the purely aquatic families such
structures are very rare, and are represented by two caeca in the
genus <i>Limnodriloides</i>. It is a remarkable fact, not yet understood,
that in certain <i>Enchytraeidae</i> and <i>Lumbriculidae</i> the spermathecae
open into the oesophagus as well as on to the exterior. The only
comparable fact among other worms is the Laurer&rsquo;s canal or genito-intestinal
canal in the Trematoda. The intestine is usually in
the higher forms provided
with a typhlosole, in
which, in <i>Pontoscolex</i>, runs
a ciliated canal or canals
communicating with the
intestine. It is possible
that this represents the
syphon or supplementary
intestine of <i>Capitellidae</i>,
which has been shown to
develop as a grooving of
the intestine ultimately
cut off from it. The intestine
has a pair of caeca
or two or three pairs (but
all lie in one segment) in
the genus <i>Pheretima</i> and
in one species of <i>Rhinodrilus</i>.
In <i>Typhoeus</i> and
<i>Megascolex</i> there are complex
glands appended to
the intestine.</p>

<p>In <i>Benhamia caecifera</i>
and at least one other
earthworm there are
numerous caeca, one pair
to each segment.</p>

<p><i>Classification.</i>&mdash;The classifications of Adolf Eduard, Grube and
Claparède separated into two subdivisions the aquatic and the terrestrial
forms. This scheme, opposed by many, has been reinstated by
Sedgwick. The chief difficulty in this scheme is offered by the
Moniligastridae, which in some degree combine the characters of
both the suborders, into neither of which will they fit accurately.
The following arrangement is a compromise:&mdash;</p>

<p>Group I. <i>Aphaneura.</i>&mdash;This group is referred by A. Sedgwick to the
Archiannelida. It is, however, though doubtless near to the base
of the Oligochaetous series, most nearly allied in the reproductive
system to the Oligochaeta. It contains but one family, <i>Aeolosomatidae</i>.
There are three pairs of spermathecae situated in segments
III-V, a testis in V and an ovary in VI. There are a clitellum
and sperm ducts which though like nephridia have a larger funnel
and a less complexly wound duct. This family consists of only one
well-known genus, <i>Aeolosoma</i>, which contains several species. They
are minute worms with coloured oil drops (green, olive green or
orange) contained in the epidermis. The nervous system is embedded
in the epidermis, and the pairs of ganglia are separated as
in <i>Serpula</i>, &amp;c.; each pair has a longish commissure between its
two ganglia. The intersegmental septa are absent save for the
division of the first segment. The large prostomium is ciliated
ventrally. The setae are either entirely capillary or there are in
addition some sigmoid setae even with bifid free extremities. This
genus also propagates asexually, like <i>Ctenodrilus</i>, which may possibly
belong to the same family. Asexual reproduction universal.</p>

<p>Group II. <i>Limicolae.</i>&mdash;With a few exceptions the Limicolae are,
as the name denotes, aquatic in habit. They are small to moderate-sized
Oligochaeta, with a smaller number of segments than in the
Terricolae. The alimentary canal is simple and a gizzard or oesophageal
diverticula rarely developed. The vascular system is simple
with as a rule direct communication between dorsal and ventral
vessels in each segment. Nerve cord lies in coelom; brain in first
segment or prostomium in many forms. Clitellum generally only
two or three segments and more anterior in position than in Terricolae.
Nephridia always paired and without plexus of blood capillaries.
Spermatheca rarely with diverticula; sperm ducts as a rule
occupying two segments only, usually opening by means of an
atrium. Sperm sacs generally occupying a good many segments
and with simple interior undivided by a network of trabeculae.
Ova large and with much yolk. Asexual reproduction only in Naids.
Egg sacs as large or nearly so as sperm sacs. Testes and ovaries
always free. The following families constitute the group, viz.
<i>Naididae</i>, <i>Enchytraeidae</i>, <i>Tubificidae</i>, <i>Lumbriculidae</i>, <i>Phreoryctidae</i>,
<i>Phreodrilidae</i>, <i>Alluroididae</i>, the latter possibly not referable to this
group.</p>

<p>Group III. <i>Moniligastres.</i>&mdash;Moderate-sized to very large Oligochaeta,
terrestrial in habit, with the appearance of Terricolae.
Generative organs anterior in position as in Limicolae. Sperm
ducts and atria as in Limicolae; egg sacs large; body wall thick;
vascular system and nephridia as in Terricolae. Only one family,
<i>Moniligastridae</i>.</p>

<p>Group IV. <i>Terricolae.</i>&mdash;Earthworms, rarely aquatic in habit.
Of small to very large size. Clitellum commonly extensive and
more posterior in position than in other groups. Vascular system
complicated without regular connexion between dorsal and ventral
vessels, except in anterior segments. Nephridia as a rule with
abundant vascular supply. Testes, and occasionally ovaries, enclosed
in sacs. Sperm sacs generally limited to one or two segments
with interior subdivided by trabeculae. Sperm ducts traverse several
segments on their way to exterior. They open in common with,
or near to, or, more rarely, into, glands which are not certainly
comparable to the atria of the Limicolae. Egg sacs minute and
functionless(?). Eggs minute with little yolk. Nephridia sometimes
very numerous in each segment. Spermathecae often with
diverticula.</p>

<p>Earthworms are divided into the following families, viz. <i>Megascolicidae</i>,
<i>Geoscolicidae</i>, <i>Eudrilidae</i>, <i>Lumbricidae</i>.</p>

<p>As an appendix to the Oligochaeta, and possibly referable to that
group, though their systematic position cannot at present be determined
with certainty, are to be placed the <i>Bdellodrilidae</i> (<i>Discodrilidae</i>
auct.), which are small parasites upon crayfish. These worms
lay cocoons like the Oligochaeta and leeches, and where they depart
from the structure of the Oligochaeta agree with that of leeches.
The body is composed of a small and limited number of segments
(not more than fourteen), and there is a sucker at each end of the
body. There are no setae and apparently only two pairs of nephridia,
of which the anterior pair open commonly by a common pore on the
third segment after the head, whose segments have not been accurately
enumerated. The intervening segments contain the genitalia,
which are on the Oligochaeta plan in that the gonads are independent
of their ducts and that there are special spermathecae, one pair.
The male ducts are either one pair or two pairs, which open by a
common and complicated efferent terminal apparatus furnished
with a protrusible penis. The ganglia are crowded at the posterior
end of the body as in leeches, and there is much tendency to the
obliteration of the coelom as in that group. <i>Pterodrilus</i> and <i>Cirrodrilus</i>
bear a few, or circles of, external processes which may be
branchiae; <i>Bdellodrilus</i> and <i>Astacobdella</i> have none. The vascular
system is as in the lower Oligochaeta. There are two chitinous
jaws in the buccal cavity, a dorsal and a ventral, which are of
specially complicated structure in <i>Cirrodrilus</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="sc">Hirudinea</span>.&mdash;The leeches are more particularly to be compared
with the Oligochaeta, and the following definition embraces the
main features in which they agree and disagree with that group.
Setae are only present in the genus <i>Acanthobdella</i>. Eyes are
present, but hardly so complex as in certain genera of Polychaetes.
The appendages of the body are reduced to branchiae, present
in certain forms. A clitellum is present. The segments of body
are few (not more than thirty-four) and fixed in number. The
anus is dorsal. One or two (anterior and posterior) suckers
always present. Nervous system always in coelom. Coelom
generally reduced to a system of tubes, sometimes communicating
with vascular system; in <i>Acanthobdella</i> and <i>Ozobranchus</i> a series
of metamerically arranged chambers as in Oligochaeta. Nephridia
always paired, rarely (<i>Pontobdella</i>) forming a network
communicating from segment to segment; lumen of nephridia
always intracellular, funnels pervious or impervious. Alimentary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page798" id="page798"></a>798</span>
canal sometimes with protrusible proboscis; never with gizzard
or oesophageal glands; intestine with caeca as a rule. Jaws
often present. Testes several pairs, rarely one pair, continuous
with sperm ducts; ovaries, one pair, continuous with oviducts;
generative pores single and median. No separate spermathecae
or septal chambers for the development of the ova and sperm.
Eggs deposited in a cocoon. Development direct. No asexual
generation. Fresh-water, marine and terrestrial. Parasitic
or carnivorous.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In external characters the Hirudinea are unmistakable and not
to be confused with other Annelids, except perhaps with the <i>Bdellodrilidae</i>,
which resemble them in certain particulars. The absence
of setae&mdash;save in <i>Acanthobdella</i>, where five of the anterior segments
possess each four pairs of setae with reserve setae placed close behind
them (fig. 14), and the presence of an anterior and posterior sucker,
produce a looping mode of progression similar to that of a Geometrid
larva. The absence of setae and the great secondary annulation
render the mapping of the segments a subject of some difficulty.
The most reliable test appears to be the nerve ganglia, which are
more distinct from the intervening connectives than in other
Annelids.</p>

<p>In the middle of the body, where the limits of the somites can be
checked by a comparison with the arrangement of the nephridia
and the gonads, and where the ganglia are quite distinct and separated
by long connectives, each ganglion is seen to consist of six
masses of cells enclosed by capsules and to give off three nerves on
each side. This corresponds
to the usual presence
(in the <i>Rhynchobdellidae</i>)
of three annuli
to each segment. Anteriorly
and posteriorly
separate ganglia have
fused. The brain consists
not only of a group
of six capsules corresponding
to the archicerebrum
of the Oligochaeta,
but of a further
mass of cells surrounding
and existing below the
alimentary canal, which
can be analysed into five
or six more separate ganglia.
The whole mass lies
in the seventh or eighth
segment. At the posterior
end of the body
there are likewise seven
separate ganglia partially
fused to form a single
ganglionic mass, which
innervates the segments lying behind the anus and corresponding
to the posterior sucker. So that a leech in which only
twenty-seven segments are apparent by the enumeration of the
annuli, separate ganglia, nephridia, lines of sensillae upon the body,
really possesses an additional seven lying behind that which is
apparently the last of the series and crowded together into a minute
space. The annuli into which segments are externally divided are
so deeply incised as to render it impossible to distinguish, as can be
readily done in the Oligochaeta as a rule, the limits of an annulus
from that of a true segment. As remarked, the prevalent number
of annuli to a segment is three in the <i>Rhynchobdellidae</i>. But in that
group (<i>Cystobranchus</i>) there may be as many as eight annuli. In
the <i>Gnathobdellidae</i> the prevailing number of annuli to a segment
is five; but here again the number is often increased, and <i>Trocheta</i>
has no less than eleven. The reason for this excessive annulation
has been seen in the limited number of segments (thirty-four) of
which the body is composed, which are laid down early and do not
increase. In the Oligochaeta, on the other hand, there is growth of
new segments. It is important to notice that the metameric plan
of growth of Chaetopods is still preserved.</p>

<p>The nephridia are like those of the Oligochaeta in general structure;
that is to say, they consist of drain-pipe cells which are placed
end to end and are perforated by their duct. The internal funnel
varies in the same way as in the Oligochaeta in the number of cells
which form it. In <i>Clepsine</i> (<i>Glossiphonia</i>) there are only three cells,
and in <i>Nephelis</i> five to eight cells. In <i>Hirudo</i> the funnel is not
pervious and is composed of a large number of cells. Externally,
the nephridium opens by a vesicle, as in many Oligochaetes whose
lumen is intercellular. In <i>Pontobdella</i> and <i>Branchellion</i> the nephridia
form a network extending from segment to segment, but there is
only one pair of funnels in each segment. Slight differences in form
have been noted between nephridia of different segments; but the
Hirudinea do not show the marked differentiation that is to be seen
in some other Chaetopods; nor do the nephridia ever acquire any
relations to the alimentary canal.</p>

<p class="pt2"><i>Coelom.</i>&mdash;The coelom of the Hirudinea differs in most genera from
that of the Oligochaeta and Polychaeta. The difference is that it is
broken up into a complex sinus system. The least modified type
is shown by <i>Acanthobdella</i>, a leech, parasitic upon fishes, in which
transverse sections (see figs. 15 and 16) show the gut, the nervous
system, &amp;c., lying in a spacious chamber which is the coelom. This
coelom is lined by peritoneal cells and is divided into a series of
metameres by septa which correspond to the segmentation of the
body, the arrangement being thus precisely like that of typical
Chaetopoda. Moreover, upon the intestine the coelomic cells are
modified into chloragogen cells. In <i>Acanthobdella</i> the testes are,
however, not contained in the general coelom, and the nephridia
lie in the septa. It is remarkable, in view of the spaciousness of the
coelom, that the funnels of the latter have not been seen.
<i>Ozobranchus</i> possesses a coelom which is less typically chaetopodous
than that of <i>Acanthobdella</i>, but more so than in other leeches. There
is a spacious cavity surrounding the gut and containing also blood-vessels,
and to some extent the generative organs, and the nervous
cord. Furthermore, in the mid region of the body this coelom is
broken up by metamerically arranged septa, as in <i>Acanthobdella</i>.
These septa are, however, rather incomplete and are not fastened
to the gut; and, as in <i>Acanthobdella</i>, the nephridia are embedded
in them. In addition to the median lacuna there are two lateral
lacunae, one upon each side. These regions of the coelom end at the
ends of the body and communicate with each other by means of a
branched system of coelomic sinuses, which are in places very fine
tubes. Neither in this genus nor in the last is there any communication
between coelom and vascular system. In <i>Clepsine</i> (<i>Glossiphonia</i>)
there is a further breaking up of the coelom. The median
lacuna no longer exists, but is represented by a dorsal and ventral
sinus. The former lodges the dorsal, the latter the ventral, blood-vessel.
The gut has no coelomic space surrounding it. A complex
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page799" id="page799"></a>799</span>
network places these sinuses and the lateral sinuses in communication.
Here also the blood system has no communication with the
sinus system of the coelom. In <i>Hirudo</i> and the <i>Gnathobdellidae</i>
there is only one system of cavities which consist of four principal
longitudinal trunks, of which the two lateral are contractile, which
communicate with a network ramifying everywhere, even among
the cells of the epidermis. The network is partly formed out of
pigmented cells which are excavated and join to form tubes, the so-called
botryoidal tissue, not found among the <i>Rhynchobdellidae</i> at
all. It seems clear from the recent investigations of A.G. Bourne
and E.S. Goodrich that the vascular system and the coelom are in
communication (as in vertebrates by means of the lymph system).
On the other hand, it has been held that in these leeches there is no
vascular system at all and that the entire system of spaces is coelom.
In favour of regarding the vascular system as totally absent, is the
fact that the median coelomic channels contain no dorsal and
ventral vessel. In favour of seeing in the lateral trunks and their
branches a vascular system, is the contractility of the former, and
the fact of the intrusion of the latter into the epidermis, matched
among the Oligochaeta, where undoubted blood capillaries perforate
the epidermis. A further fact must be considered in deciding this
question, which is the discovery of ramifying coelomic tubes, approaching
close to, but not entering, the epidermis in the Polychaete
<i>Arenicola</i>. These tubes are lined by flattened epithelium and often
contain blood capillaries; they communicate with the coelom and
are to be regarded as prolongation of it into the thickness of the
body wall.</p>

<p><i>Gonads and Gonad Ducts.</i>&mdash;The gonads and their ducts in the
Hirudinea invariably form a closed system of cavities entirely shut
off from the coelom in which they lie. There is thus a broad resemblance
to the <i>Eudrilidae</i>, to which group of Oligochaeta the Hirudinea
are further akin by reason of the invariably unpaired condition
of the generative apertures, and the existence of a copulatory
apparatus (both of which characters, however, are present occasionally
in other Oligochaeta).</p>

<p>The testes are more numerous than the ovaries, of which latter
there are never more than one pair. The testes vary in numbers of
pairs. Four (<i>Ozobranchus</i>) to six (<i>Glossiphonia</i>) or ten (<i>Philaemon</i>)
are common numbers. In <i>Acanthobdella</i>, however, the testes of each
side of the body have grown together to form a continuous band,
which extends in front of external pore. Each testis communicates
by means of an efferent duct with a common collecting duct of its
side of the body, which opens on to the exterior by means of a protrusible
penis, and to which is sometimes appended a seminal vesicle.
The efferent ducts are ciliated, and there is a patch of cilia at the
point where they communicate with the cavity of each testis. The
ovaries are more extensive in some forms (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Ozobranchus</i>) than
in others, where they are small rounded bodies. The two ducts
continuous with the gonads open by a common vagina on to the
exterior behind the male pores. This &ldquo;vagina&rdquo; is sometimes of
exaggerated size. Thus, in <i>Philaemon pungens</i> (Lambert) it has
the form of a large sac, into which open by a single orifice the conjoined
oviducts. From this vagina arises a narrow duct leading to
the exterior. In <i>Ozobranchus</i> the structures in question are still
more complicated. The two long ovarian sacs communicate with
each other by a transverse bridge before uniting to form the terminal
canal. Into each ovarian sac behind the transverse junction opens
a slender tube, which is greatly coiled, and, in its turn, opens into
a spherical &ldquo;spermathecal sac.&rdquo; From this an equally slender tube
proceeds, which joins its fellow of the opposite side, and the two form
a thick, walled tube, which opens on to the exterior within the bursa
copulatrix through which the penis protrudes. These two last-mentioned
types show features which can be, as it seems, matched
in the Eudrilidae.</p>

<p>The gonads develop (O. Bürger) in coelomic spaces close to
nephridial funnels, which have, however, no relation to the gonad
ducts. The ovaries are solid bodies, of which the outer layer becomes
separated from the plug of cells lying within; thus a cavity is formed
which is clearly coelom. This cavity and its walls becomes prolonged
to form the oviducts. A stage exactly comparable to the
stage in the leeches, where the ovary is surrounded by a closed sac,
has been observed in <i>Eudrilus</i>. In this Annelid later the sac in
question joins its fellow, passing beneath the nerve cord exactly
as in the leech, and also grows out to reach the exterior. The sole
difference is therefore that in <i>Eudrilus</i> the ovarian sac gives rise
to a tube which bifurcates, one branch meeting a corresponding
branch of the other ovary of the pair, while the second branch
reaches the exterior. In the leech the two branches are fused into
one. We have here clearly a case of a true coelomoduct performing
the function of an oviduct in both leeches and <i>Eudrilidae</i>. The facts
just referred to suggest further comparisons between the Hirudinea
and <i>Eudrilidae</i>. The large sacs which have been termed vagina
are suggestive of the large coelomic spermathecae in Eudrilids, a
comparison which needs, however, embryological data, not at
present forthcoming, for its justification. It is at least clear that in
<i>Ozobranchus</i> this comparison is justifiable; but only probable, or
perhaps possible, in the case of <i>Philaemon</i>. In the former, the duct,
leading from the ovarian sac, and swelling along its course into the
spherical sac, the &ldquo;spermatheca,&rdquo; is highly suggestive of the oviduct
and receptaculum of the <i>Eudrilidae</i>.</p>

<p>The testes during development become hollowed out and are
prolonged into the vasa efferentia. These ducts therefore have not
their exact counterparts in the Oligochaeta, unless we are to assume
that they collectively are represented by the seminal vesicles of
earthworms and the vasa deferentia. It is to be noted that the
Hirudinea differ from the Oligochaeta in that the male pore is in
advance of the gonads (except in <i>Acanthobdella</i>, which here, as in
so many points, approximates to the Oligochaeta), whereas in
Oligochaeta that pore is behind the gonads (again with an exception,
<i>Allurus</i>).</p>

<p><i>Classification</i>.&mdash;The Hirudinea may be divided into three families:&mdash;</p>

<p>(i.) <i>Rhynchobdellidae</i>.&mdash;A protrusible proboscis exists, but there
are no jaws. The blood is colourless. <i>Pontobdella</i>, <i>Glossiphonia</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>(ii.) <i>Gnathobdellidae</i>.&mdash;A proboscis absent, but jaws usually
present. Blood coloured red with haemoglobin. <i>Hirudo</i>, <i>Nephelis</i>,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>(iii.) <i>Acanthobdellidae</i>.&mdash;Proboscis present, but short. Paired
setae of Oligochaetous pattern present in anterior segments. Blood
red. <i>Acanthobdella</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAETOSOMATIDA,<a name="ar62" id="ar62"></a></span> a small group of minute, free-living,
aquatic organisms which are usually placed as an annex to
the Nematoda. Indeed Mechnikov, to
whom we owe much of our knowledge
of these forms, calls them &ldquo;creeping
Nematoda.&rdquo; They are usually found
amongst seaweed in temperate seas, but
they are probably widely distributed;
some are fresh-water. The genus <i>Chaetosoma</i>,
with the two species <i>Ch. claparedii</i>
and <i>Ch. ophicephalum</i> and the genus
<i>Tristicochaeta</i>, have swollen heads. The
third genus <i>Rhabdogaster</i> has no such
distinct head, though the body may be
swollen anteriorly. The mouth is terminal
and anterior and surrounded by a
ring of spicules or a half-ring of hooks.
Scattered hairs cover the body. Just in
front of the anus there is in <i>Chaetosoma</i>
a double, and in <i>Tristicochaeta</i> a triple
row of about fifteen stout cylindrical
projections upon which the animals
creep. The females are a little larger
than the males; in <i>Ch. claparedii</i> the
former attain a length of 1.5 mm., the
latter of  1.12 mm.    The mouth opens
into an oesophagus which passes into an
intestine; this opens by a ventral anus
situated a little in front of the posterior
end.    The testis is single, and its duct
opens with the anus,  and is provided
with a couple of spicules.    The ovary is
double, and the oviducts open by a median ventral pore about
the middle of the body; in this region there is a second swelling
both in <i>Chaetosoma</i> and in <i>Rhabdogaster</i>.    The last-named form
is in the female 0.36 mm. in length.    In it the hairs are confined
to the dorsal middle line and the creeping setae are hooked, of
a finer structure than in <i>Chaetosoma</i>, and situated so far forward
that the vagina opens amongst them.    <i>Ch. ophicephalum</i> has
been taken in the English Channel.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAFER,<a name="ar63" id="ar63"></a></span> a word used in modern speech to distinguish the
beetles of the family <i>Scarabaeidae</i>, and more especially those
species which feed on leaves in the adult state. The word is
derived from the O. Eng. <i>ceafor</i>, and it is interesting to note
that the cognate Ger. <i>Käfer</i> is applied to beetles of all kinds.
For the characters of the <i>Scarabaeidae</i> see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Coleoptera</a></span>. This
family includes a large number of beetles, some of which feed on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page800" id="page800"></a>800</span>
dung and others on vegetable tissues. The cockchafers and their
near allies belong to the subfamily <i>Melolonthinae</i>, and the
rose-chafers to the <i>Cetoniinae</i>; in both the beetles eat leaves, and
their grubs spend a long life underground devouring roots.
In Britain the Melolonthines that are usually noted as injurious
are the two species of cockchafer (<i>Melolontha vulgaris</i> and <i>M.
hippocastani</i>), large heavy beetles with black pubescent pro-thorax,
brown elytra and an elongated pointed tail-process;
the summer-chafer (<i>Rhizotrogus solstitialis</i>), a smaller pale
brown chafer; and the still smaller garden-chafer or &ldquo;cocker-bundy&rdquo;
(<i>Phyllopertha horticola</i>), which has a dark green pro-thorax
and brown elytra. Of the Cetoniines, the beautiful
metallic green rose-chafer, <i>Cetonia aurata</i>, sometimes causes
damage, especially in gardens. The larvae of the chafers are
heavy, soft-skinned grubs, with hard brown heads provided with
powerful mandibles, three pairs of well-developed legs, and a
swollen abdomen. As they grow, the larvae become strongly
flexed towards the ventral surface, and lie curled up in their
earthen cells, feeding on roots. The larval life lasts several
years, and in hard frosts the grubs go deep down away from the
surface. Pupation takes place in the autumn, and though the
perfect insect emerges from the cuticle very soon afterwards,
it remains in its underground cell for several months, not making
its way to the upper air until the ensuing summer. After pairing,
the female crawls down into the soil to lay her eggs. The grubs
of chafers, when turned up by the plough, are greedily devoured
by poultry, pigs and various wild birds. When the beetles
become so numerous as to call for destruction, they are usually
shaken off the trees where they rest on to sheets or tarred boards.
On the continent of Europe chafers are far more numerous than
in the United Kingdom, and the rural governments in France
give rewards for their destruction. D. Sharp states that in the
department of Seine-inférieure 867,173,000 cockchafers and
647,000,000 larvae were killed in the four years preceding 1870.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAFFARINAS,<a name="ar65" id="ar65"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Zaitarines</span>, a group of islands belonging
to Spain off the north coast of Morocco, near the Algerian
frontier, 2½ m. to the north of Cape del Agna. The largest of
these isles, Del Congreso, is rocky and hilly. It has a watch-house
on the coast nearest to Morocco. Isabella II., the central
island, contains several batteries, barracks and a penal convict
settlement. The Spanish government has undertaken the construction
of breakwaters to unite this island with the neighbouring
islet of El Rey, with a view to enclose a deep and already sheltered
anchorage. This roadstead affords a safe refuge for many large
vessels. The Chaffarinas, which are the <i>Tres Insulae</i> of the
Romans and the <i>Zafr&#257;n</i> of the Arabs, were occupied by Spain
in 1848. The Spanish occupation anticipated by a few days a
French expedition sent from Oran to annex the islands to Algeria.
The population of the islands is under 1000.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAFFEE, ADNA ROMANZA<a name="ar66" id="ar66"></a></span> (1842-&emsp;&emsp;), American general,
was born at Orwell, Ohio, on the 14th of April 1842. At the
outbreak of the Civil War he entered the United States cavalry
as a private, and he rose to commissioned rank in 1863,
becoming brevet captain in 1865. He remained in the army
after the war and took part with distinction in many Indian
campaigns. His promotion was, however, slow, and he was at
the age of fifty-six still a lieutenant-colonel of cavalry. But in
1898, at the outbreak of the Spanish-American War, he was made
brigadier-general and soon afterwards major-general of volunteers.
In the Cuban campaign he won particular distinction, and the
victory of the Americans in the action of El Caney was in large
measure due to his careful personal reconnaissances of the ground
to be attacked and to the endurance of his own brigade. After
reverting for a time to the rank of brigadier-general, he was made
a major-general U.S.V. again in 1900 and was appointed to
command the United States contingent in China. He took a
brilliant and successful part in the advance on Peking and the
relief of the Legations. In 1901 he became a major-general in
the regular army, and in 1901-1902 commanded the Division of
the Philippines. In 1902-1903 he commanded the Department of
the East, and from 1904 to 1906 was chief of the general staff
of the army. In 1904 he received the rank of lieutenant-general
in the United States army, being the first enlisted man of the
regular army to attain this, the highest rank in the service.
He was retired at his own request on the 1st of February 1906,
after more than forty years&rsquo; service.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAFFINCH<a name="ar67" id="ar67"></a></span> (<i>Fringilla coelebs</i>), the common English name
of a bird belonging to the family <i>Fringillidae</i> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Finch</a></span>), and
distinguished, in the male sex, by the deep greyish blue of its
crown feathers, the yellowish green of its rump, the white of the
wing coverts, so disposed as to form two conspicuous bars, and
the reddish brown passing into vinous red of the throat and
breast. The female is drab, but shows the same white markings
as the male, and the young males resemble the females until
after the first autumn moult, when they gradually assume the
plumage of their sex. The chaffinch breeds early in the season,
and its song may often be heard in February. Its nest, which
is a model of neatness and symmetry, it builds on trees and bushes,
preferring such as are overgrown with moss and lichens. It is
chiefly composed of moss and wool, lined internally with grass,
wool, feathers, and whatever soft material the locality affords.
The outside consists of moss and lichens, and according to Selby,
&ldquo;is always accordant with the particular colour of its situation.&rdquo;
When built in the neighbourhood of towns the nest is somewhat
slovenly and untidy, being often composed of bits of dirty straw,
pieces of paper and blackened moss; in one instance, near
Glasgow, the author of the <i>Birds of the West of Scotland</i> found
several postage-stamps thus employed. It lays four or five eggs
of a pale purplish buff, streaked and spotted with purplish red.
In spring the chaffinch is destructive to early flowers, and to
young radishes and turnips just as they appear above the surface;
in summer, however, it feeds principally on insects and their
larvae, while in autumn and winter its food consists of grain and
other seeds. On the continent of Europe the chaffinch is a
favourite song-bird, especially in Germany, where great attention
is paid to its training.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAFING-DISH<a name="ar68" id="ar68"></a></span> (from the O. Fr. <i>chaufer</i>, to make warm),
a kind of portable grate heated with charcoal, and used for
cooking or keeping food warm. In a light form, and heated
over a spirit lamp, it is also used for cooking various dainty
dishes at table. The employment of the chafing-dish for the
latter purpose has been largely restored in modern cookery.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHAGOS,<a name="ar69" id="ar69"></a></span> a group of atolls in the Indian Ocean, belonging to
Britain, disposed in circular form round the Chagos bank, in
4° 44&prime; to 7° 39&prime; S., and 70° 55&prime; to 72° 52&prime; E. The atolls on the
south and east side of the bank, which has a circumference of
about 270 m., have disappeared through subsidence; a few&mdash;Egmont,
Danger, Eagle, and Three Brothers&mdash;still remain on
the east side, but most of the population (about 700) is centred
on Diego Garcia, which lies on the south-east side, and is nearly
13 m. long by 6 m. wide. The lagoon, which is enclosed by two
coral barriers and accessible to the largest vessels on the north
side, forms one of the finest natural harbours in the world. The
group, which has a total land area of 76 sq. m., is dependent for
administrative purposes on Mauritius, and is regularly visited
by vessels from that colony. The only product is cocoa-nut oil,
of which about 106,000 gallons are annually exported. The
French occupied the islands in 1791 from Mauritius, and the oil
industry (from which the group is sometimes called the Oil Islands)
came into the hands of French Creoles.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAGRES,<a name="ar70" id="ar70"></a></span> a village of the Republic of Panama, on the
Atlantic coast of the Isthmus, at the mouth of the Chagres
river, and about 8 m. W. of Colon. It has a harbour from 10 to
12 ft. deep, which is difficult to enter, however, on account of
bars at its mouth. The port was discovered by Columbus in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page801" id="page801"></a>801</span>
1502, and was opened for traffic with Panama, on the Pacific
coast, by way of the Chagres river, in the 16th century.
With the decline of Porto Bello in the 18th century
Chagres became the chief Atlantic port of the Isthmus, and was
at the height of its importance during the great rush of gold-hunters
across the Isthmus to California in 1849 and the years
immediately following. With the completion of the Panama
railway in 1855, however, travel was diverted to Colon, and
Chagres soon became a village of miserable huts, with no evidence
of its former importance. On a high rock at the mouth of the
river stands the castle of Lorenzo, which was destroyed by Sir
Henry Morgan when he captured the town in 1671, but
was rebuilt soon afterwards by the Spaniards. Chagres was
again captured in 1740 by British forces under Admiral Edward
Vernon.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHAIN<a name="ar71" id="ar71"></a></span> (through the O. Fr. <i>choeine</i>, <i>choene</i>, &amp;c., from Lat.
<i>catena</i>), a series of links of metal or other material so connected
together that the whole forms a flexible band or cord. Chains
are used for a variety of purposes, such as fastening, securing,
or connecting together two or more objects, supporting or lifting
weights, transmitting mechanical power, &amp;c.; or as an ornament
to serve as a collar, as a symbol of office or state, or as part of
the insignia of an order of knighthood; or as a device from
which to hang a jewelled or other pendant, a watch, &amp;c. (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Collar</a></span>). Ornamental chains are made with a great variety of
links, but those intended for utilitarian purposes are mostly of
two types. In stud chains a stud or brace is inserted across each
link to prevent its sides from collapsing inwards under strain,
whereas in open link chains the links have no studs. The addition
of studs is reckoned to increase the load which the chain can
safely bear by 50%. Small chains of the open-link type are
to a great extent made by machinery. For larger sizes the
smith cuts off a length of iron rod of suitable diameter, forms it
while hot to the shape of the link by repeated blows of his hammer,
and welds together the two ends of the link, previously slipped
inside its fellow, by the aid of the same tool; in some cases the
bending is done in a mechanical press and the welding under a
power hammer (see also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Cable</a></span>). Weldless chains are also made;
in A.G. Strathern&rsquo;s process, for instance, cruciform steel bars
are pressed, while hot, into links, each without join and engaging
with its neighbours. Chains used for transmitting power are
known as pitch-chains; the chain of a bicycle (<i>q.v.</i>) is an example.</p>

<p>From the use of the chain as employed to bind or fetter a
prisoner or slave, comes the figurative application to anything
which serves as a constraining or restraining force; and from
its series of connected links, to any series of objects, events,
arguments, &amp;c., connected by succession, logical sequence or
reasoning. Specific uses are for a measuring line in land-surveying,
consisting of 100 links, <i>i.e.</i> iron rods, 7.92 in. in length,
making 22 yds. in all, hence a lineal measure of that length;
and, as a nautical term, for the contrivance by which the lower
shrouds of a mast are extended and secured to the ship&rsquo;s
sides, consisting of dead-eyes, chain-plates, and chain-wale or
&ldquo;channel.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAIR<a name="ar72" id="ar72"></a></span> (in. Mid. Eng. <i>choere</i>, through O. Fr. <i>chaëre</i> or <i>chaiere</i>,
from Lat. <i>cathedra</i>, later <i>caledra</i>, Gr. <span class="grk" title="kathedra">&#954;&#945;&#952;&#941;&#948;&#961;&#945;</span>, seat, cf. &ldquo;cathedral&rdquo;;
the modern Fr. form <i>chaise</i>, a chair, has been adopted in English
with a particular meaning as a form of carriage; <i>chaire</i> in French
is still used of a professorial or ecclesiastical &ldquo;chair,&rdquo; or <i>cathedra</i>),
a movable seat, usually with four legs, for a single person, the
most varied and familiar article of domestic furniture. The
chair is of extreme antiquity, although for many centuries and
indeed for thousands of years it was an appanage of state and
dignity rather than an article of ordinary use. &ldquo;The chair&rdquo; is
still extensively used as the emblem of authority in the House
of Commons and in public meetings. It was not, in fact, until
the 16th century that it became common anywhere. The chest,
the bench and the stool were until then the ordinary seats of
everyday life, and the number of chairs which have survived
from an earlier date is exceedingly limited; most of such examples
are of ecclesiastical or seigneurial origin. Our knowledge
of the chairs of remote antiquity is derived almost entirely from
monuments, sculpture and paintings. A few actual examples
exist in the British Museum, in the Egyptian museum at Cairo,
and elsewhere. In ancient Egypt they appear to have been of
great richness and splendour. Fashioned of ebony and ivory,
or of carved and gilded wood, they were covered with costly
stuffs and supported upon representations of the legs of beasts
of the chase or the figures of captives. An arm-chair in fine
preservation found in a tomb in the Valley of the Kings is
astonishingly similar, even in small details, to that &ldquo;Empire&rdquo;
style which followed Napoleon&rsquo;s campaign in Egypt. The
earliest monuments of Nineveh represent a chair without a back
but with tastefully carved legs ending in lions&rsquo; claws or bulls&rsquo;
hoofs; others are supported by figures in the nature of caryatides
or by animals. The earliest known form of Greek chair,
going back to five or six centuries before Christ, had a back but
stood straight up, front and back. On the frieze of the Parthenon
Zeus occupies a square seat with a bar-back and thick turned
legs; it is ornamented with winged sphinxes and the feet of
beasts. The characteristic Roman chairs were of marble, also
adorned with sphinxes; the curule chair was originally very
similar in form to the modern folding chair, but eventually
received a good deal of ornament.</p>

<p>The most famous of the very few chairs which have come down
from a remote antiquity is the reputed chair of St Peter in St
Peter&rsquo;s at Rome. The wooden portions are much decayed, but
it would appear to be Byzantine work of the 6th century, and
to be really an ancient <i>sedia gestatoria</i>. It has ivory carvings
representing the labours of Hercules. A few pieces of an earlier
oaken chair have been let in; the existing one, Gregorovius
says, is of acacia wood. The legend that this was the curule
chair of the senator Pudens is necessarily apocryphal. It is not,
as is popularly supposed, enclosed in Bernini&rsquo;s bronze chair,
but is kept under triple lock and exhibited only once in a century.
Byzantium, like Greece and Rome, affected the curule form of
chair, and in addition to lions&rsquo; heads and winged figures of
Victory and dolphin-shaped arms used also the lyre-back which
has been made familiar by the pseudo-classical revival of the
end of the 18th century. The chair of Maximian in the cathedral
of Ravenna is believed to date from the middle of the 6th century.
It is of marble, round, with a high back, and is carved in high
relief with figures of saints and scenes from the Gospels&mdash;the
Annunciation, the Adoration of the Magi, the flight into Egypt
and the baptism of Christ. The smaller spaces are filled with
carvings of animals, birds, flowers and foliated ornament.
Another very ancient seat is the so-called &ldquo;Chair of Dagobert&rdquo; in
the Louvre. It is of cast bronze, sharpened with the chisel and
partially gilt; it is of the curule or faldstool type and supported
upon legs terminating in the heads and feet of animals. The
seat, which was probably of leather, has disappeared. Its attribution
depends entirely upon the statement of Suger, abbot of
St Denis in the 12th century, who added a back and arms. Its
age has been much discussed, but Viollet-le-Duc dated it to early
Merovingian times, and it may in any case be taken as the oldest
faldstool in existence. To the same generic type belongs
the famous abbots&rsquo; chair of Glastonbury; such chairs might
readily be taken to pieces when their owners travelled. The
<i>faldisterium</i> in time acquired arms and a back, while retaining
its folding shape. The most famous, as well as the most ancient,
English chair is that made at the end of the 13th century for
Edward I., in which most subsequent monarchs have been
crowned. It is of an architectural type and of oak, and was
covered with gilded <i>gesso</i> which long since disappeared.</p>

<p>Passing from these historic examples we find the chair monopolized
by the ruler, lay or ecclesiastical, to a comparatively
late date. As the seat of authority it stood at the head of the
lord&rsquo;s table, on his dais, by the side of his bed. The seigneurial
chair, commoner in France and the Netherlands than in England,
is a very interesting type, approximating in many respects to
the episcopal or abbatial throne or stall. It early acquired a
very high back and sometimes had a canopy. Arms were invariable,
and the lower part was closed in with panelled or
carved front and sides&mdash;the seat, indeed, was often hinged and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page802" id="page802"></a>802</span>
sometimes closed with a key. That we are still said to sit &ldquo;in&rdquo;
an arm-chair and &ldquo;on&rdquo; other kinds of chairs is a reminiscence of
the time when the lord or seigneur sat &ldquo;in his chair.&rdquo; These
throne-like seats were always architectural in character, and as
Gothic feeling waned took the distinctive characteristics of
Renaissance work. It was owing in great measure to the Renaissance
that the chair ceased to be an appanage of state, and
became the customary companion of whomsoever could afford
to buy it. Once the idea of privilege faded the chair speedily
came into general use, and almost at once began to reflect the
fashions of the hour. No piece of furniture has ever been so
close an index to sumptuary changes. It has varied in size,
shape and sturdiness with the fashion not only of women&rsquo;s dress
but of men&rsquo;s also. Thus the chair which was not, even with its
arms purposely suppressed, too ample during the several reigns
of some form or other of hoops and farthingale, became monstrous
when these protuberances disappeared. Again, the costly laced
coats of the dandy of the 18th and early 19th centuries were so
threatened by the ordinary form of seat that a &ldquo;conversation
chair&rdquo; was devised, which enabled the buck and the ruffler to sit
with his face to the back, his valuable tails hanging unimpeded
over the front. The early chair almost invariably had arms, and
it was not until towards the close of the 16th century that the
smaller form grew common.</p>

<p>The majority of the chairs of all countries until the middle of
the 17th century were of oak without upholstery, and when it became
customary to cushion them, leather was sometimes employed;
subsequently velvet and silk were extensively used, and at a
later period cheaper and often more durable materials. Leather
was not infrequently used even for the costly and elaborate
chairs of the faldstool form&mdash;occasionally sheathed in thin plates
of silver&mdash;which Venice sent all over Europe. To this day,
indeed, leather is one of the most frequently employed materials
for chair covering. The outstanding characteristic of most
chairs until the middle of the 17th century was massiveness and
solidity. Being usually made of oak, they were of considerable
weight, and it was not until the introduction of the handsome
Louis XIII. chairs with cane backs and seats that either weight
or solidity was reduced. Although English furniture derives
so extensively from foreign and especially French and Italian
models, the earlier forms of English chairs owed but little to
exotic influences. This was especially the case down to the end
of the Tudor period, after which France began to set her mark
upon the British chair. The squat variety, with heavy and
sombre back, carved like a piece of panelling, gave place to a
taller, more slender, and more elegant form, in which the framework
only was carved, and attempts were made at ornament
in new directions. The stretcher especially offered opportunities
which were not lost upon the cabinet-makers of the Restoration.
From a mere uncompromising cross-bar intended to strengthen
the construction it blossomed, almost suddenly, into an elaborate
scroll-work or an exceedingly graceful semicircular ornament
connecting all four legs, with a vase-shaped knob in the centre.
The arms and legs of chairs of this period were scrolled, the
splats of the back often showing a rich arrangement of spirals
and scrolls. This most decorative of all types appears to have
been popularized in England by the cavaliers who had been in
exile with Charles II. and had become familiar with it in the
north-western parts of the European continent. During he
reign of William and Mary these charming forms degenerated
into something much stiffer and more rectangular, with a solid,
more or less fiddle-shaped splat and a cabriole leg with pad feet.
The more ornamental examples had cane seats and ill-proportioned
cane backs. From these forms was gradually developed
the Chippendale chair, with its elaborately interlaced back, its
graceful arms and square or cabriole legs, the latter terminating
in the claw and ball or the pad foot. Hepplewhite, Sheraton
and Adam all aimed at lightening the chair, which, even in the
master hands of Chippendale, remained comparatively heavy.
The endeavour succeeded, and the modern chair is everywhere
comparatively slight. Chippendale and Hepplewhite between
them determined what appears to be the final form of the chair,
for since their time practically no new type has lasted, and in
its main characteristics the chair of the 20th century is the direct
derivative of that of the later 18th.</p>

<p>The 18th century was, indeed, the golden age of the chair,
especially in France and England, between which there was
considerable give and take of ideas. Even Diderot could not
refrain from writing of them in his <i>Encyclopédie</i>. The typical
Louis Seize chair, oval-backed and ample of seat, with descending
arms and round-reeded legs, covered in Beauvais or some such
gay tapestry woven with Boucher or Watteau-like scenes, is a
very gracious object, in which the period reached its high-water
mark. The Empire brought in squat and squabby shapes,
comfortable enough no doubt, but entirely destitute of inspiration.
English Empire chairs were often heavier and more sombre
than those of French design. Thenceforward the chair in all
countries ceased to attract the artist. The <i>art nouveau</i> school
has occasionally produced something of not unpleasing simplicity;
but more often its efforts have been frankly ugly or even
grotesque. There have been practically no novelties, with the
exception perhaps of the basket-chair and such like, which have
been made possible by modern command over material. So
much, indeed, is the present indebted to the past in this
matter that even the revolving chair, now so familiar in
offices, has a pedigree of something like four centuries (see also

colony founded on a site so obviously inferior to that which was
within view on the opposite shore, that it received from the
oracle the name of &ldquo;the City of the Blind.&rdquo; In its early history
it shared the fortunes of Byzantium, was taken by the satrap
Otanes, vacillated long between the Lacedaemonian and the
Athenian interests, and was at last bequeathed to the Romans
by Attalus III. of Pergamum (133 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>). It was partly destroyed
by Mithradates, but recovered during the Empire, and in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 451
was the seat of the Fourth General Council. It fell under the
repeated attacks of the barbarian hordes who crossed over after
having ravaged Byzantium, and furnished an encampment to
the Persians under Chosroes, c. 616-626. The Turks used it as
a quarry for building materials for Constantinople. The site
is now occupied by the village of Kadikeui (&ldquo;Village of the
Judge&rdquo;), which forms the tenth &ldquo;cercle&rdquo; of the municipality
of Constantinople. Pop. about 33,000, of whom 8000 are
Moslems. There is a large British colony with a church, and
also Greek and Armenian churches and schools, and a training
college for Roman Catholic Armenians. To the S. are the ruins
of Panteichion (mod. <i>Pendik</i>), where Belisarius is said to have
lived in retirement.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHALCEDON, COUNCIL OF,<a name="ar76" id="ar76"></a></span> the fourth ecumenical council of
the Catholic Church, was held in 451, its occasion being the
Eutychian heresy and the notorious &ldquo;Robber Synod&rdquo; (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Eutyches</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ephesus, Council of</a></span>), which called forth
vigorous protests both in the East and in the West, and a loud
demand for a new general council, a demand that was ignored
by the Eutychian Theodosius II., but speedily granted by his
successor, Marcian, a &ldquo;Flavianist.&rdquo; In response to the imperial
summons, five to six hundred bishops, all Eastern, except the
Roman legates and two Africans, assembled in Chalcedon on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page803" id="page803"></a>803</span>
8th of October 451. The bishop of Rome claimed for his legates
the right to preside, and insisted that any act that failed to receive
their approval would be invalid. The first session was tumultuous;
party feeling ran high, and scurrilous and vulgar epithets
were bandied to and fro. The acts of the Robber Synod were
examined; fraud, violence and coercion were charged against
it; its entire proceedings were annulled, and, at the third
session, its leader, Dioscurus, was deposed and degraded. The
emperor requested a declaration of the true faith; but the
sentiment of the council was opposed to a new symbol. It
contented itself with reaffirming the Nicene and Constantinopolitan
creeds and the Ephesine formula of 431, and accepting,
only after examination, the Christological statement contained
in the <i>Epistola Dogmatica</i> of Leo I. (<i>q.v.</i>) to Flavianus. Thus
the council rejected both Nestorianism and Eutychianism, and
stood upon the doctrine that Christ had two natures, each
perfect in itself and each distinct from the other, yet perfectly
united in one person, who was at once both God and man. With
this statement, which was formally subscribed in the presence
of the emperor, the development of the Christological doctrine
was completed, but not in a manner to obviate further controversy
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Monophysites</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Monothelites</a></span>).</p>

<p>The remaining sessions, vii.-xvi., were occupied with matters
of discipline, complaints, claims, controversies and the like.
Canons were adopted, thirty according to the generally received
tradition, although the most ancient texts contain but twenty-eight,
and, as Hefele points out, the so-called twenty-ninth and
thirtieth are properly not canons, but repetitions of proposals
made in a previous session.</p>

<p>The most important enactments of the council of Chalcedon
were the following: (1) the approval of the canons of the first
three ecumenical councils and of the synods of Ancyra, Neo-Caesarea,
Changra, Antioch and Laodicea; (2) forbidding trade,
secular pursuits and war to the clergy, bishops not even being
allowed to administer the property of their dioceses; (3) forbidding
monks and nuns to marry or to return to the world;
likewise forbidding the establishment of a monastery in any
diocese without the consent of the bishop, or the disestablishment
of a monastery once consecrated; (4) punishing with
deposition an ordination or clerical appointment made for
money; forbidding &ldquo;absolute ordination&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i> without assignment
to a particular charge), the translation of clerics except
for good cause, the enrolment of a cleric in two churches at once,
and the performance of sacerdotal functions outside of one&rsquo;s
diocese without letters of commendation from one&rsquo;s bishop;
(5) confirming the jurisdiction of bishops over all clerics, regular
and secular alike, and punishing with deposition any conspiracy
against episcopal authority; (6) establishing a gradation of
ecclesiastical tribunals, viz. bishop, provincial synod, exarch
of the diocese, patriarch of Constantinople (obviously the council
could not here have been legislating for the entire church);
forbidding clerics to be running to Constantinople with complaints,
without the consent of their respective bishops; (7)
confirming the possession of rural parishes to those who had
actually administered them for thirty years, providing for the
adjudication of conflicting claims, and guaranteeing the integrity
of metropolitan provinces; (8) confirming the third canon of
the second ecumenical council, which accorded to Constantinople
equal privileges (<span class="grk" title="isa presbeia">&#7988;&#963;&#945; &#960;&#961;&#949;&#963;&#946;&#949;&#8150;&#945;</span>) with Rome, and the second
rank among the patriarchates, and, in addition, granting to
Constantinople patriarchal jurisdiction over Pontus, Asia and
Thrace.</p>

<p>The Roman legates, who were absent (designedly?) when this
famous twenty-eighth canon was adopted, protested against
it, but in vain, the imperial commissioners deciding in favour of
its regularity and validity. Leo I., although he recognized the
council as ecumenical and confirmed its doctrinal decrees, rejected
canon xxviii. on the ground that it contravened the sixth canon
of Nicaea and infringed the rights of Alexandria and Antioch.
In what proportion zeal for the ancient canons and the rights
of others, and jealous fear of encroachment upon his own jurisdiction,
were mixed in the motives of Leo, it would be interesting
to know. The canon was universally received in the East, and
was expressly confirmed by the Quinisext Council, 692 (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Constantinople, Councils of</a></span>).</p>

<p>The emperor Marcian approved the doctrinal decrees of the
council and enjoined silence in regard to theological questions.
Eutyches and Dioscurus and their followers were deposed and
banished. But harmony was not thus to be restored; hardly
had the council dissolved when the church was plunged into the
Monophysite controversy.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHALCEDONY,<a name="ar77" id="ar77"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Calcedony</span> (sometimes called by old
writers cassidoine), a variety of native silica, often used as an
ornamental stone. The present application of the term is comparatively
modern. The &ldquo;chalcedonius&rdquo; of Pliny was quite
a different mineral, being a green stone from the copper-mines
of Chalcedon, in Asia Minor, whence the name. There has been
some confusion between chalcedony and the ancient &ldquo;carcedonia,&rdquo;
a stone which seems to have been a carbuncle from Africa,
brought by way of Carthage (<span class="grk" title="Karchêdôn">&#922;&#945;&#961;&#967;&#951;&#948;&#974;&#957;</span>). Our chalcedony
was probably included by the ancients among the various kinds
of jasper and agate, especially the varieties termed &ldquo;leucachates&rdquo;
and &ldquo;cerachates.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By modern mineralogists the name chalcedony is restricted
to those kinds of silica which occur not in distinct crystals like
ordinary quartz, but in concretionary, mammillated or stalactitic
forms, which break with a fine splintery fracture, and
display a delicate fibrous structure. Chalcedony may be regarded
as a micro-crystalline form of quartz. It is rather softer and
less dense than crystallized quartz, its hardness being about
6.5 and its specific gravity 2.6, the difference being probably
due to the presence of a small amount of opaline silica between
the fibres. Chalcedony is a translucent substance of rather
waxy lustre, presenting great variety of colours, though usually
white, grey, yellow or brown. A rare blue chalcedony is sometimes
polished under the name of &ldquo;sapphirine&rdquo;&mdash;a term applied
also to a distinct mineral (an aluminium-magnesium silicate)
from Greenland.</p>

<p>Chalcedony occurs as a secondary mineral in volcanic rocks,
representing usually the silica set free by the decomposition of
various silicates, and deposited in cracks, forming veins, or in
vesicular hollows, forming amygdales. Its occurrence gives the
name to Chalcedony Park, Arizona. It is found in the basalts
of N. Ireland, the Faroe Isles and Iceland: it is common in
the traps of the Deccan in India, and in volcanic rocks in Uruguay
and Brazil. Certain flat oval nodules from a decomposed lava
(augite-andesite) in Uruguay present a cavity lined with quartz
crystals and enclosing liquid (a weak saline solution), with a
movable air-bubble, whence they are called &ldquo;enhydros&rdquo; or
water-stones. Very fine examples of stalactitic chalcedony, in
whimsical forms, have been yielded by some of the Cornish
copper-mines. The surface of chalcedony is occasionally coated
with a delicate bluish bloom. A chalcedonic deposit in the form
of concentric rings, on fossils and fragments of limestone in S.
Devon, is known as &ldquo;orbicular silica&rdquo; or &ldquo;beekite,&rdquo; having
been named after Dr Henry Beeke, dean of Bristol, who first
directed attention to such deposits. Certain pseudomorphs of
chalcedony after datolite, from Haytor in Devonshire, have
received the name of &ldquo;haytorite.&rdquo; Optical examination of
many chalcedonic minerals by French mineralogists has shown
that they are aggregates of various fibrous crystalline bodies
differing from each other in certain optical characters, whence
they are distinguished as separate minerals under such names
as calcedonite, pseudocalcedonite, quartzine, lutecite and lussatite.
Many coloured and variegated chalcedonies are cut and polished
as ornamental stones, and are described under special headings.
Chalcedony has been in all ages the commonest of the stones used
by the gem-engraver.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHALCIS, <a name="ar79" id="ar79"></a></span>the chief town of the island of Euboea in Greece,
situated on the strait of the Euripus at its narrowest point.
The name is preserved from antiquity and is derived from the
Greek <span class="grk" title="chalkos">&#967;&#945;&#955;&#954;&#972;&#962;</span> (copper, bronze), though there is no trace of
any mines in the neighbourhood. Chalcis was peopled by an
Ionic stock which early developed great industrial and colonizing
activity. In the 8th and 7th centuries it founded thirty town-ships
on the peninsula of Chalcidice, and several important cities
in Sicily (<i>q.v.</i>). Its mineral produce, metal-work, purple and
pottery not only found markets among these settlements, but
were distributed over the Mediterranean in the ships of Corinth
and Samos. With the help of these allies Chalcis engaged the
rival league of its neighbour Eretria (<i>q.v.</i>) in the so-called
Lelantine War, by which it acquired the best agricultural district
of Euboea and became the chief city of the island. Early in the
6th century its prosperity was broken by a disastrous war with
the Athenians, who expelled the ruling aristocracy and settled
a cleruchy on the site. Chalcis subsequently became a member
of both the Delian Leagues. In the Hellenistic period
it gained <span class="correction" title="amended from inportance">importance</span> as a fortress by which the Macedonian
rulers controlled central Greece. It was used by kings Antiochus
III. of Syria (192) and Mithradates VI. of Pontus (88) as a base
for invading Greece. Under Roman rule Chalcis retained a
measure of commercial prosperity; since the 6th century <span class="scs">A.D.</span>
it again served as a fortress for the protection of central Greece
against northern invaders. From 1209 it stood under Venetian
control; in 1470 it passed to the Ottomans, who made it the
seat of a pasha. In 1688 it was successfully held against a
strong Venetian attack. The modern town has about 10,000
inhabitants, and maintains a considerable export trade which
received an impetus from the establishment of railway connexion
with Athens and Peiraeus (1904). It is composed of two parts&mdash;the
old walled town towards the Euripus, called the Castro,
where the Jewish and Turkish families who have remained there
mostly dwell; and the more modern suburb that lies outside it,
which is chiefly occupied by the Greeks. A part of the walls of
the Castro and many of the houses within it were shaken down
by the earthquake of 1894; part has been demolished in the
widening of the Euripus. The most interesting object is the
church of St Paraskeve, which was once the chief church of the
Venetians; it dates from the Byzantine period, though many
of its architectural features are Western. There is also a Turkish
mosque, which is now used as a guard-house.</p>

only Athenian Byzantine writer. Hardly anything is known
of his life. He wrote a history, in ten books, of the period from
1298-1463, describing the fall of the Greek empire and the rise
of the Ottoman Turks, which forms the centre of the narrative,
down to the conquest of the Venetians and Mathias, king of
Hungary, by Mahommed II. The capture of Constantinople
he rightly regarded as an historical event of far-reaching
importance, although the comparison of it to the fall of Troy is
hardly appropriate. The work incidentally gives a quaint and
interesting sketch of the manners and civilization of England,
France and Germany, whose assistance the Greeks sought to
obtain against the Turks. Like that of other Byzantine writers,
Chalcondyles&rsquo; chronology is defective, and his adherence to the
old Greek geographical nomenclature is a source of confusion.
For his account of earlier events he was able to obtain information
from his father, who was one of the most prominent
men in Athens during the struggles between the Greek and
Frankish nobles. His model is Thucydides (according to Bekker,
Herodotus); his language is tolerably pure and correct, his
style simple and clear. The text, however, is in a very corrupt

<p><span class="bold">CHALDAEA.<a name="ar81" id="ar81"></a></span> The expressions &ldquo;Chaldaea&rsquo;&rdquo; and &ldquo;Chaldaeans&rdquo;
are frequently used in the Old Testament as equivalents for
&ldquo;Babylonia&rdquo; and &ldquo;Babylonians.&rdquo; Chaldaea was really the
name of a country, used in two senses. It was first applied to
the extreme southern district, whose ancient capital was the
city of <i>B&#299;t Yak&#299;n</i>, the chief seat of the renowned Chaldaean
rebel Merodach-baladan, who harassed the Assyrian kings
Sargon and Sennacherib. It is not as yet possible to fix the
exact boundaries of the original home of the Chaldaeans, but
it may be regarded as having been the long stretch of alluvial
land situated at the then separate mouths of the Tigris and
Euphrates, which rivers now combine to flow into the Persian
Gulf in the waters of the majestic <i>Shatt el &lsquo;Arab</i>.</p>

<p>The name &ldquo;Chaldaea,&rdquo; however, soon came to have a more
extensive application. In the days of the Assyrian king Ramm&#257;n-nir&#257;ri
III. (812-783 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), the term <i>mat Kald&#363;</i> covered practically
all Babylonia. Furthermore, Merodach-baladan was called by
Sargon II. (722-705 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) &ldquo;king of the land of the Chaldaeans&rdquo;
and &ldquo;king of the land of B&#299;t Yak&#299;n&rdquo; after the old capital city,
but there is no satisfactory evidence that Merodach-baladan
had the right to the title &ldquo;Babylonian.&rdquo; The racial distinction
between the Chaldaeans and the Babylonians proper seems to
have existed until a much later date, although it is almost
certain that the former were originally a Semitic people. That
they differed from the Arabs and Aramaeans is also seen from the
distinction made by Sennacherib (705-681 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) between the
Chaldaeans and these races. Later, during the period covering
the fall of Assyria and the rise of the Neo-Babylonian empire,
the term <i>mat Kald&#363;</i> was not only applied to all Babylonia,
but also embraced the territory of certain foreign nations who
were later included by Ezekiel (xxiii. 23) under the expression
&ldquo;Chaldaeans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As already indicated, the Chaldaeans were most probably
a Semitic people. It is likely that they first came from Arabia,
the supposed original home of the Semitic races, at a very early
date along the coast of the Persian Gulf and settled in the
neighbourhood of Ur (&ldquo;Ur of the Chaldees,&rdquo; Gen. xi. 28), whence
they began a series of encroachments, partly by warfare and
partly by immigration, against the other Semitic Babylonians.
These aggressions after many centuries ended in the Chaldaean
supremacy of Nabopolassar and his successors (c. 626 ff.),
although there is no positive proof that Nabopolassar was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page805" id="page805"></a>805</span>
purely Chaldaean in blood. The sudden rise of the later Babylonian
empire under Nebuchadrezzar, the son of Nabopolassar,
must have tended to produce so thorough an amalgamation of
the Chaldaeans and Babylonians, who had theretofore been
considered as two kindred branches of the same original Semite
stock, that in the course of time no perceptible differences
existed between them. A similar amalgamation, although in
this case of two peoples originally racially distinct, has taken
place in modern times between the Manchu Tatars and the
Chinese. It is quite evident, for example, from the Semitic
character of the Chaldaean king-names, that the language of
these Chaldaeans differed in no way from the ordinary Semitic
Babylonian idiom which was practically identical with that of
Assyria. Consequently, the term &ldquo;Chaldaean&rdquo; came quite
naturally to be used in later days as synonymous with &ldquo;Babylonian.&rdquo;
When subsequently the Babylonian language went
out of use and Aramaic took its place, the latter tongue was
wrongly termed &ldquo;Chaldee&rdquo; by Jerome, because it was the only
language known to him used in Babylonia. This error was
followed until a very recent date by many scholars.</p>

<p>The derivation of the name &ldquo;Chaldaean&rdquo; is extremely
uncertain. Peter Jensen has conjectured with slight probability
that the Chaldaeans were Semitized Sumerians, <i>i.e.</i> a non-Semitic
tribe which by contact with Semitic influences had lost
its original character. There seems to be little or no evidence
to support such a view. Friedrich Delitzsch derived the name
&ldquo;Chaldaean&rdquo; = <i>Kasd&#299;m</i> from the non-Semitic Ka&#353;&#353;ites who
held the supremacy over practically all Babylonia during an
extended period (c. 1783-1200 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>). This theory seems also
to be extremely improbable. It is much more likely that the
name &ldquo;Chaldaean&rdquo; is connected with the Semitic stem <i>kas&#257;du</i>
(conquer), in which case <i>Kaldi-Ka&#353;di</i>, with the well-known
interchange of <i>l</i> and <i>&#353;</i>, would mean &ldquo;conquerors.&rdquo; It is also
possible that <i>Ka&#353;du-Kaldu</i> is connected with the proper name
Chesed, who is represented as having been the nephew of
Abraham (Gen. xxii. 22). There is no connexion whatever
between the Black Sea peoples called &ldquo;Chaldaeans&rdquo; by Xenophon
(<i>Anab</i>. vii. 25) and the Chaldaeans of Babylonia.</p>

<p>In Daniel, the term &ldquo;Chaldaeans&rdquo; is very commonly employed
with the meaning &ldquo;astrologers, astronomers,&rdquo; which sense also
appears in the classical authors, notably in Herodotus, Strabo
and Diodorus. In Daniel i. 4, by the expression &ldquo;tongue of
the Chaldaeans,&rdquo; the writer evidently meant the language in
which the celebrated Babylonian works on astrology and divination
were composed. It is now known that the literary idiom
of the Babylonian wise men was the non-Semitic Sumerian;
but it is not probable that the late author of Daniel (c. 168 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>)
was aware of this fact.</p>

<p>The word &ldquo;Chaldaean&rdquo; is used in Daniel in two senses. It is
applied as elsewhere in the Old Testament as a race-name to the
Babylonians (Dan. iii. 8, v. 30, ix. 1); but the expression is
used oftener, either as a name for some special class of magicians,
or as a term for magicians in general (ix. 1). The transfer of the
name of the people to a special class is perhaps to be explained
in the following manner. As just shown, &ldquo;Chaldaean&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Babylonian&rdquo; had become in later times practically synonymous,
but the term &ldquo;Chaldaean&rdquo; had lived on in the secondary restricted
sense of &ldquo;wise men.&rdquo; The early <i>Kaldi</i> had seized and
held from very ancient times the region of old Sumer, which
was the centre of the primitive non-Semitic culture. It seems
extremely probable that these Chaldaean Semites were so strongly
influenced by the foreign civilization as to adopt it eventually as
their own. Then, as the Chaldaeans soon became the dominant
people, the priestly caste of that region developed into a Chaldaean
institution. It is reasonable to conjecture that southern
Babylonia, the home of the old culture, supplied Babylon and
other important cities with priests, who from their descent were
correctly called &ldquo;Chaldaeans.&rdquo; This name in later times, owing
to the racial amalgamation of the Chaldaeans and Babylonians,
lost its former national force, and became, as it occurs in Daniel,
a distinctive appellation of the Babylonian priestly class. It is
possible, though not certain, that the occurrence of the word <i>kal&#363;</i>
(priest) in Babylonian, which has no etymological connexion
with <i>Kald&#363;</i>, may have contributed paronomastically towards
the popular use of the term &ldquo;Chaldaeans&rdquo; for the Babylonian
Magi. (See also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Astrology</a></span>.)</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHALDEE,<a name="ar82" id="ar82"></a></span> a term sometimes applied to the Aramaic portions
of the biblical books of Ezra and Daniel or to the vernacular
paraphrases of the Old Testament (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Targum</a></span>). The explanation
formerly adopted and embodied in the name Chaldee is
that the change took place in Babylon. That the so-called
Biblical Chaldee, in which considerable portions of the books of
Ezra and Daniel are written, was really the language of Babylon
was supposed to be clear from Dan. ii. 4, where the Chaldaeans
are said to have spoken to the king in Aramaic. But the cuneiform
inscriptions show that the language of the Chaldaeans was
Assyrian; and an examination of the very large part of the
Hebrew Old Testament written later than the exile proves conclusively
that the substitution of Aramaic for Hebrew as the
vernacular of Palestine took place very gradually. Hence
scholars are now agreed that the term &ldquo;Chaldee&rdquo; is a misnomer,
and that the dialect so called is really the language of the South-Western
Arameans, who were the immediate neighbours of the
Jews (W. Wright, <i>Comparative Grammar of the Semitic Languages</i>,
p. 16). (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Semitic Languages</a></span>.)</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHALICE<a name="ar83" id="ar83"></a></span> (through a central O. Fr. form of the Lat. <i>calix</i>,
<i>calicis</i>, cup), a drinking-vessel of the cup or goblet form, now only
used of the cup used in the celebration of the Eucharist (<i>q.v.</i>).
For the various forms which the &ldquo;chalice&rdquo; so used has taken,
see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Drinking-Vessels</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Plate</a></span>. When, in the eucharistic
service, water is mixed with the wine, the &ldquo;chalice&rdquo; is known
as the &ldquo;mixed chalice.&rdquo; This has been customary both in the
Eastern and Western Churches from early times. The Armenian
Church does not use the &ldquo;mixed chalice.&rdquo; It was used in the
English Church before the Reformation. According to the
present law of the English Church, the mixing of the water with
wine is lawful, if this is not done as part of or during the services,
<i>i.e.</i> if it is not done ceremonially (<i>Martin</i> v. <i>Mackonochie</i>, 1868,
L.R. 2 P.C. 365; <i>Read</i> v. <i>Bp. of Lincoln</i>, 1892, A C. 664).</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHALIER, JOSEPH<a name="ar84" id="ar84"></a></span> (1747-1793), French Revolutionist. He
was destined by his family for the church, but entered business,
and became a partner in a firm at Lyons for which he travelled
in the Levant, in Italy, Spain and Portugal. He was in Paris in
1789, and entered into relations with Marat, Camille Desmoulins
and Robespierre. On his return to Lyons, Chalier was the first
to be named member of the municipal bureau. He organized
the national guard, applied the civil constitution of the clergy,
and regulated the finances of the city so as to tax the rich heavily
and spare the poor. Denounced to the Legislative Assembly
by the directory of the department of Rhone-et-Loire for having
made a nocturnal domiciliary perquisition, he was sent to the
bar of the Assembly, which approved of his conduct. In the
election for mayor of Lyons, in November 1792, he was defeated
by a Royalist. Then Chalier became the orator and leader of
the Jacobins of Lyons, and induced the other revolutionary clubs
and the commune of his city to arrest a great number of Royalists
in the night of the 5th and 6th of February 1793. The mayor,
supported by the national guard, opposed this project. Chalier
demanded of the Convention the establishment of a revolutionary
tribunal and the levy of a revolutionary army at Lyons. The
Convention refused, and the anti-revolutionary party, encouraged
by this refusal, took action. On the 29th and 30th of May 1793
the sections rose; the Jacobins were dispossessed of the municipality
and Chalier arrested. On the 15th of July, in spite
of the order of the Convention, he was brought before the
criminal tribunal of the Rhone-et-Loire, condemned to death,
and guillotined the next day. The Terrorists paid a veritable
worship to his memory, as to a martyr of Liberty.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHALK,<a name="ar85" id="ar85"></a></span> the name given to any soft, pulverulent, pure white
limestone. The word is an old one, having its origin in the
Saxon <i>cealc</i>, and the hard form &ldquo;kalk&rdquo; is still in use amongst
the country folk of Lincolnshire. The German <i>Kalk</i> comprehends
all forms of limestone; therefore a special term, <i>Kreide</i>, is employed
for chalk&mdash;French <i>craie</i>. From being used as a common
name, denoting a particular material, the word was subsequently
utilized by geologists as an appellation for the <i>Chalk formation</i>;
and so prominent was this formation in the eyes of the earlier
workers that it imposed its name upon a whole system of rocks,
the Cretaceous (Lat. <i>creta</i>, chalk), although this rock itself is by
no means generally characteristic of the system as a whole.</p>

<p>The Chalk formation, in addition to the typical chalk material&mdash;<i>creta
scriptoria</i>&mdash;comprises several variations; argillaceous
kinds&mdash;<i>creta marga</i> of Linnaeus&mdash;known locally as malm, marl,
clunch, &amp;c.; and harder, more stony kinds, called rag, freestone,
rock, hurlock or harrock in different districts. In certain parts
of the formation layers of nodular flints (<i>q.v.</i>) abound; in parts,
it is inclined to be sandy, or to contain grains of glauconite
which was originally confounded with another green mineral,
chlorite, hence the name &ldquo;chloritic marl&rdquo; applied to one of the
subdivisions of the chalk. In its purest form chalk consists of
from 95 to 99% of calcium carbonate (carbonate of lime); in
this condition it is composed of a mass of fine granular particles
held together by a somewhat feeble calcareous cement. The
particles are mostly the broken tests of foraminifera, along with
the débris of echinoderm and molluscan shells, and many minute
bodies, like coccoliths, of somewhat obscure nature.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The earliest attempts at subdivision of the Chalk formation
initiated by Wm. Phillips were based upon lithological characters,
and such a classification as &ldquo;Upper Chalk with Flints,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lower
Chalk without Flints,&rdquo; &ldquo;Chalk marl or Grey chalk,&rdquo; was generally
in use in England until W. Whitaker established the following order
in 1865:&mdash;</p>

<table class="ws" summary="Contents">

<p>In France, a similar system of classification was in vogue, the
subdivisions being <i>craie blanche</i>, <i>craie tufan</i>, <i>craie chloritée</i>, until
1843 when d&rsquo;Orbigny proposed the term <i>Senonien</i> for the Upper
Chalk and <i>Turonien</i> for the Lower; later he divided the <i>Turonien</i>,
giving the name <i>Cénomanien</i> to the lower portion. The subdivisions
of d&rsquo;Orbigny were based upon the fossil contents and not upon the
lithological characters of the rocks. In 1876 Prof. Ch. Barrois
showed how d&rsquo;Orbigny&rsquo;s classification might be applied to the
British chalk rocks; and this scheme has been generally adopted
by geologists, although there is some divergence of opinion as to
the exact position of the base line of the Cenomanian.</p>

<p>Since Prof. Barrois introduced the zonal system of subdivision
(C. Evans had used a similar scheme six years earlier), our knowledge
of the English chalk has been greatly increased by the work
of Jukes-Browne and William Hill, and particularly by the
laborious studies of Dr A.W. Rowe. Instead of employing the
mixed assemblage of animals indicated as zone fossils in the
table, A. de Grossouvre proposed a scheme for the north of
France based upon ammonite faunas alone, which he contended
would be of more general applicability (<i>Recherches sur la Craie
Supérieure</i>, Paris, 1901).</p>

<p>The Upper Chalk has a maximum thickness in England of
about 1000 ft., but post-cretaceous erosion has removed much
of it in many districts. It is more constant in character, and
more typically chalky than the lower stages; flints are abundant,
and harder nodular beds are limited to the lower portions, where
some of the compact limestones are known as &ldquo;chalk rock.&rdquo;
The thickness of the Middle Chalk varies from about 100 to 240 ft.;
flints become scarcer in descending from the upper to the lower
portions. The whole is more compact than the upper stage,
and nodular layers are more frequent&mdash;the &ldquo;chalk rock&rdquo; of
Dorset and the Isle of Wight belong to this stage. At the base
is the hard &ldquo;Melbourne rock.&rdquo; The thickness of the Lower
Chalk in England varies from 60 to 240 ft. This stage includes
part of the &ldquo;white chalk without flints,&rdquo; the &ldquo;chalk marl,&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;grey chalk.&rdquo; The Totternhoe stone is a hard freestone
found locally in this stage. The basement bed in Norfolk is a
pure limestone, but very frequently it is marly with grains of
sand and glauconite, and often contains phosphatic nodules;
this facies is equivalent to the &ldquo;Cambridge Greensand&rdquo; of
some districts and the &ldquo;chloritic marl&rdquo; of others. In Devonshire
the Lower Chalk has become thin sandy calcareous series.</p>

<p>The chalk can be traced in England from Flamborough Head
in Yorkshire, in a south-westerly direction, to the coast of Dorset;
and it not only underlies the whole of the S.E. corner, where it
is often obscured by Tertiary deposits, but it can be followed
across the Channel into northern France. Rocks of the same
age as the chalk are widespread (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Cretaceous System</a></span>);
but the variety of limestone properly called by this name is
almost confined to the Anglo-Parisian basin. Some chalk occurs
in the great Cretaceous deposits of Russia, and in Kansas, Iowa,
Nebraska and S. Dakota in the United States. Hard white
chalk occurs in Ireland in Antrim, and on the opposite shore of
Scotland in Mull and Morven.</p>

<p><i>Economic Products of the Chalk.</i>&mdash;Common chalk has been
frequently used for rough building purposes, but the more
important building stones are &ldquo;Beer stone,&rdquo; from Beer Head
in Devonshire, &ldquo;Sutton stone&rdquo; from a little north of Beer, and
the &ldquo;Totternhoe stone.&rdquo; It is burned for lime, and when mixed
with some form of clay is used for the manufacture of cement;
chalk marl has been used alone for this purpose. As a manure,
it has been much used as a dressing for
clayey land. Flints from the chalk are used
for road metal and concrete, and have been
employed in building as a facing for walls.
Phosphatic nodules for manure have been
worked from the chloritic marl and Cambridge
Greensand, and to some extent from
the Middle Chalk. The same material is
worked at Ciply in Belgium and Picardy in
France. Chalk is employed in the manufacture
of carbonate of soda, in the preparation
of carbon dioxide, and in many other
chemical processes; also for making paints,
crayons and tooth-powder. <i>Whiting</i> or
<i>Spanish white</i>, used to polish glass and
metal, is purified chalk prepared by triturating
common chalk with a large quantity of
water, which is then decanted and allowed
to deposit the finely-divided particles it
holds in suspension.</p>

<p><i>Chalk   Scenery.</i>&mdash;Where   exposed   at   the
surface,   chalk produces   rounded,   smooth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page807" id="page807"></a>807</span>
grass-covered hills as in the Downs of southern England and the
Wolds of Yorkshire and Lincolnshire. The hills are often intersected
by clean-cut dry valleys. It forms fine cliffs on the coast
of Kent, Yorkshire and Devonshire.</p>

<p>Chalk is employed medicinally as a very mild astringent either
alone or more usually with other astringents. It is more often
used, however, for a purely mechanical action, as in the preparation
hydrargyrum cum creta. As an antacid its use has been
replaced by other drugs.</p>

<p><i>Black chalk</i> or <i>drawing slate</i> is a soft carbonaceous schist,
which gives a black streak, so that it can be used for drawing or
writing. <i>Brown chalk</i> is a kind of umber. <i>Red chalk</i> or <i>reddle</i>
is an impure earthy variety of haematite. <i>French chalk</i> is a
soft variety of steatite, a hydrated magnesium silicate.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHALLAMEL, JEAN BAPTISTE MARIUS AUGUSTIN<a name="ar88" id="ar88"></a></span> (1818-1894),
French historian, was born in Paris on the 18th of March
1818. His writings consist chiefly of popular works, which
enjoyed great success. The value of some of his books is enhanced
by numerous illustrations, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Histoire-museé de la
Révolution française</i>, which appeared in 50 numbers in 1841-1842
(3rd ed., in 72 numbers, 1857-1858); <i>Histoire de la mode en
France; la toilette des femmes depuis l&rsquo;époque gallo-romaine
jusqu&rsquo;à nos jours</i> (1874, with 12 plates; new ed., 1880, with
21 coloured plates). His <i>Mémoires du peuple française</i> (1865-1873)
and <i>La France et les Français a travers les siécles</i> (1882) at
least have the merit of being among the first books written on
the social history of France. In this sense Challamel was a
pioneer, of no great originality, it is true, but at any rate of
fairly wide information. He died on the 20th of October 1894.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHALLEMEL-LACOUR, PAUL AMAND<a name="ar89" id="ar89"></a></span> (1827-1896), French
statesman, was born at Avranches on the 19th of May 1827.
After passing through the École Normale Supérieure he became
professor of philosophy successively at Pau and at Limoges.
The <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i> of 1851 caused his expulsion from France for his
republican opinions. He travelled on the continent, and in 1856
settled down as professor of French literature at the Polytechnic
of Zürich. The amnesty of 1859 enabled him to return to France,
but a projected course of lectures on history and art was immediately
suppressed. He now supported himself by his pen, and
became a regular contributor to the reviews. On the fall of the
Second Empire in September 1870 the government of national
defence appointed him prefect of the department of the Rhone,
in which capacity he had to suppress the Communist rising at
Lyons. Resigning his post on the 5th of February 1871, he was
in January 1872 elected to the National Assembly, and in 1876
to the Senate. He sat at first on the Extreme Left; but his
philosophic and critical temperament was not in harmony with
the recklessness of French radicalism, and his attitude towards
political questions underwent a steady modification, till the close
of his life saw him the foremost representative of moderate
republicanism. During Gambetta&rsquo;s lifetime, however, Challemel-Lacour
was one of his warmest supporters, and he was for a time
editor of Gambetta&rsquo;s organ, the <i>République française</i>. In 1879
he was appointed French ambassador at Bern, and in 1880
was transferred to London; but he lacked the suppleness and
command of temper necessary to a successful diplomatist. He
resigned in 1882, and in February 1883 became minister of foreign
affairs in the Jules Ferry cabinet, but retired in November
of the same year. In 1890 he was elected vice-president of the
Senate, and in 1893 succeeded Jules Ferry as its president. His
influence over that body was largely due to his clear and reasoned
eloquence, which placed him at the head of contemporary French
orators. In 1893 he also became a member of the French
Academy. He distinguished himself by the vigour with which he
upheld the Senate against the encroachments of the chamber, but
in 1895 failing health forced him to resign, and he died in Paris on
the 26th of October 1896. He published a translation of A.
Heinrich Ritter&rsquo;s <i>Geschichte der Philosophie</i> (1861); <i>La Philosophie
individualiste: étude sur Guillaume de Humboldt</i> (1864);
and an edition of the works of Madame d&rsquo;Épinay (1869).</p>

accusation, a &ldquo;calumny&rdquo;), originally a charge against a person

<p><span class="bold">&ldquo;CHALLENGER&rdquo; EXPEDITION.<a name="ar91" id="ar91"></a></span> The scientific results of
several short expeditions between 1860 and 1870 encouraged
the council of the Royal Society to approach the British government,
on the suggestion of Sir George Richards, hydrographer
to the admiralty, with a view to commissioning a vessel for
a prolonged cruise for oceanic exploration. The government
detailed H.M.S. &ldquo;Challenger,&rdquo; a wooden corvette of 2306 tons,
for the purpose. Captain (afterwards Sir) George Nares was
placed in command, with a naval crew; and a scientific staff
was selected by the society with Professor (afterwards Sir) C.
Wyville Thomson as director. The staff included Mr (afterwards
Sir) John Murray and Mr H.N. Moseley, biologists; Dr von
Willemoes-Suhm, Commander Tizard, and Mr J.Y. Buchanan,
chemist and geologist. A complete scheme of instructions was
drawn up by the society. The &ldquo;Challenger&rdquo; sailed from Portsmouth
in December 1872. For nearly a year the work of the
expedition lay in the Atlantic, which was crossed several times.
Teneriffe, the Bermudas, the Azores, Madeira, the Cape Verd
Islands, Bahia and Tristan da Cunha were successively visited,
and in October 1873 the ship reached Cape Town. Steering then
south-east and east she visited the various islands between 45°
and 50° S., and reached Kerguelen Island in January 1874.
She next proceeded southward about the meridian of 80° E.
She was the first steamship to cross the Antarctic circle, but
the attainment of a high southerly latitude was not an object of
the voyage, and early in March the ship left the south polar
regions and made for Melbourne. Extensive researches were
now made in the Pacific. The route led by New Zealand, the
Fiji Islands, Torres Strait, the Banda Sea, and the China Sea to
Hong Kong. The western Pacific was then explored northward
to Yokohama, after which the &ldquo;Challenger&rdquo; struck across the
ocean by Honolulu and Tahiti to Valparaiso. She then coasted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page808" id="page808"></a>808</span>
southward, penetrated the Straits of Magellan, touched at
Montevideo, recrossed the Atlantic by Ascension and the Azores,
and reached Sheerness in May 1876. This voyage is without
parallel in the history of scientific research. The <i>&rdquo;Challenger&rdquo;
Report</i> was issued in fifty volumes (London, 1880-1895), mainly
under the direction of Sir John Murray, who succeeded Wyville
Thomson in this work in 1882. Specialists in every branch of
science assisted in its production. The zoological collections
alone formed the basis for the majority of the volumes; the
deep-sea soundings and samples of the deposits, the chemical
analysis of water samples, the meteorological, water-temperature,
magnetic, geological, and botanical observations were fully
worked out, and a summary of the scientific results, narrative
of the cruise and indices were also provided.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHALLONER, RICHARD<a name="ar92" id="ar92"></a></span> (1691-1781), English Roman
Catholic prelate, was born at Lewes, Sussex, on the 29th of
September 1691. After the death of his father, who was a rigid
Dissenter, his mother, left in poverty, lived with some Roman
Catholic families. Thus it came about that he was brought up
as a Roman Catholic, chiefly at the seat of Mr Holman at
Warkworth, Northamptonshire, where the Rev. John Gother,
a celebrated controversialist, officiated as chaplain. In 1704 he
was sent to the English College at Douai, where he was ordained
a priest in 1716, took his degrees in divinity, and was appointed
professor in that faculty. In 1730 he was sent on the English
mission and stationed in London. The controversial treatises
which he published in rapid succession attracted much attention,
particularly his <i>Catholic Christian Instructed</i> (1737), which was
prefaced by a witty reply to Dr Conyers Middleton&rsquo;s <i>Letters from
Rome, showing an Exact Conformity between Popery and Paganism</i>.
Middleton is said to have been so irritated that he endeavoured
to put the penal laws in force against his antagonist, who
prudently withdrew from London. In 1741 Challoner was raised
to the episcopal dignity at Hammersmith, and nominated co-adjutor
with right of succession to Bishop Benjamin Petre,
vicar-apostolic of the London district, whom he succeeded in
1758. He resided principally in London, but was obliged to
retire into the country during the &ldquo;No Popery&rdquo; riots of 1780.
He died on the 12th of January 1781, and was buried at Milton,
Berkshire. Bishop Challoner was the author of numerous controversial
and devotional works, which have been frequently
reprinted and translated into various languages. He compiled
the <i>Garden of the Soul</i> (1740 ?), which continues to be the most
popular manual of devotion among English-speaking Roman
Catholics, and he revised an edition of the Douai version of the
Scriptures (1749-1750), correcting the language and orthography,
which in many places had become obsolete. Of his historical
works the most valuable is one which was intended to be a Roman
Catholic antidote to Foxe&rsquo;s well-known martyrology. It is
entitled <i>Memoirs of Missionary Priests and other Catholicks of
both Sexes who suffered Death or Imprisonment in England on
account of their Religion, from the year 1577 till the end of
the reign of Charles II.</i> (2 vols. 1741, frequently reprinted).
He also published anonymously, in 1745, the lives of English,
Scotch and Irish saints, under the title of <i>Britannia Sancta</i>, an
interesting work which has, however, been superseded by that of
Alban Butler.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHALMERS, ALEXANDER<a name="ar93" id="ar93"></a></span> (1750-1834), Scottish writer,
was born in Aberdeen on the 29th of March 1759. He was
educated as a doctor, but gave up this profession for journalism,
and he was for some time editor of the <i>Morning Herald</i>. Besides
editions of the works of Shakespeare, Beattie, Fielding, Johnson,
Warton, Pope, Gibbon, Bolingbroke, he published <i>A General
Biographical Dictionary</i> in 32 vols.(1812-1817); a <i>Glossary to
Shakspeare</i> (1797); an edition of Steevens&rsquo;s Shakespeare
(1809); and the <i>British Essayists</i>, beginning with the <i>Tatler</i> and
ending with the <i>Observer</i>, with biographical and historical prefaces
and a general index. He died in London on the 19th of December
1834.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHALMERS, GEORGE<a name="ar94" id="ar94"></a></span> (1742-1825), Scottish antiquarian and
political writer, was born at Fochabers, a village in the county of
Moray, in 1742. His father, James Chalmers, was a grandson of
George Chalmers of Pittensear, a small estate in the parish of
Lhanbryde, now St Andrews-Lhanbryde, in the same county,
possessed by the main line of the family from about the beginning
of the 17th to the middle of the 18th century. After completing
the usual course at King&rsquo;s College, Aberdeen, young Chalmers
studied law in Edinburgh for several years. Two uncles on the
father&rsquo;s side having settled in America, he visited Maryland in
1763, with the view, it is said, of assisting to recover a tract of
land of some extent about which a dispute had arisen, and was in
this way induced to commence practice as a lawyer at Baltimore,
where for a time he met with much success. Having, however,
espoused the cause of the Royalist party on the breaking out of
the American War of Independence, he found it expedient to
abandon his professional prospects in the New World, and return
to his native country. For the losses he had sustained as a
colonist he received no compensation, and several years elapsed
before he obtained an appointment that placed him in a state of
comfort and independence.</p>

<p>In the meantime Chalmers applied himself with great diligence
and assiduity to the investigation of the history and establishment
of the English colonies in North America; and enjoying
free access to the state papers and other documents preserved
among what were then termed the plantation records, he became
possessed of much important information. His work entitled
<i>Political Annals of the present United Colonies from their Settlement
to the Peace of 1763</i>, 4to, London, 1780, was to have formed two
volumes; but the second, which should have contained the period
between 1688 and 1763, never appeared. The first volume,
however, is complete in itself, and traces the original settlement of
the different American colonies, and the progressive changes in
their constitutions and forms of government as affected by the
state of public affairs in the parent kingdom. Independently of
its value as being compiled from original documents, it bears
evidence of great research, and has been of essential benefit to
later writers. Continuing his researches, he next gave to the
world <i>An Estimate of the Comparative Strength of Britain during
the Present and Four Preceding Reigns</i>, London, 1782, which passed
through several editions. At length, in August 1786, Chalmers,
whose sufferings as a Royalist must have strongly recommended
him to the government of the day, was appointed chief clerk to
the committee of privy council on matters relating to trade, a
situation which he retained till his death in 1825, a period of
nearly forty years. As his official duties made no great demands
on his time, he had abundant leisure to devote to his favourite
studies,&mdash;the antiquities and topography of Scotland having
thenceforth special attractions for his busy pen.</p>

<p>Besides biographical sketches of Defoe, Sir John Davies, Allan
Ramsay, Sir David Lyndsay, Churchyard and others, prefixed to
editions of their respective works, Chalmers wrote a life of
Thomas Paine, the author of the <i>Rights of Man</i>, which he published
under the assumed name of Francis Oldys, A.M., of the
University of Pennsylvania; and a life of Ruddiman, in which
considerable light is thrown on the state of literature in Scotland
during the earlier part of the last century. His life of Mary,
Queen of Scots, in two 4to vols., was first published in 1818. It is
founded on a MS. left by John Whitaker, the historian of Manchester;
but Chalmers informs us that he found it necessary to
rewrite the whole. The history of that ill-fated queen occupied
much of his attention, and his last work, <i>A Detection of the Love-Letters
lately attributed in Hugh Campbell&rsquo;s work to Mary Queen of
Scots</i>, is an exposure of an attempt to represent as genuine some
fictitious letters said to have passed between Mary and Bothwell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page809" id="page809"></a>809</span>
which had fallen into deserved oblivion. In 1797 appeared his
<i>Apology for the Believers in the Shakespeare Papers which were
exhibited in Norfolk Street</i>, followed by other tracts on the same
subject. These contributions to the literature of Shakespeare
are full of curious matter, but on the whole display a great waste of
erudition, in seeking to show that papers which had been proved
forgeries might nevertheless have been genuine. Chalmers also
took part in the Junius controversy, and in <i>The Author of Junius
Ascertained, from a Concatenation of Circumstances amounting
to Moral Demonstration</i>, Lond. 1817, 8vo, sought to fix the authorship
of the celebrated letters on Hugh Boyd. In 1824 he published
<i>The Poetical Remains of some of the Scottish Kings, now first
collected</i>; and in the same year he edited and presented as a
contribution to the Bannatyne Club <i>Robene and Makyne and the
Testament of Cresseid, by Robert Henryson</i>. His political writings
are equally numerous. Among them may be mentioned <i>Collection
of Treaties between Great Britain and other Powers</i>, Lond.
1790, 2 vols. 8vo; <i>Vindication of the Privileges of the People in
respect to the Constitutional Right of Free Discussion</i>, &amp;c., Lond.
1796, 8vo, published anonymously; <i>A Chronological Account of
Commerce and Coinage in Great Britain from the Restoration till
1810</i>, Lond. 1810, 8vo; <i>Opinions of Eminent Lawyers on various
points of English Jurisprudence, chiefly concerning the Colonies,
Fisheries, and Commerce of Great Britain</i>, Lond. 1814, 2 vols.
8vo; <i>Comparative Views of the State of Great Britain before and
since the War</i>, Lond. 1817, 8vo.</p>

<p>But Chalmers&rsquo;s greatest work is his <i>Caledonia</i>, which, however,
he did not live to complete. The first volume appeared in 1807,
and is introductory to the others. It is divided into four books,
treating successively of the Roman, the Pictish, the Scottish
and the Scoto-Saxon periods, from 80 to 1306 <span class="scs">A.D.</span> In these we are
presented, in a condensed form, with an account of the people,
the language and the civil and ecclesiastical history, as well as
the agricultural and commercial state of Scotland during the
first thirteen centuries of our era. Unfortunately the chapters
on the Roman period are entirely marred by the author&rsquo;s having
accepted as genuine Bertram&rsquo;s forgery <i>De Situ Britanniae</i>;
but otherwise his opinions on controverted topics are worthy of
much respect, being founded on a laborious investigation of all
the original authorities that were accessible to him. The second
volume, published in 1810, gives an account of the seven
south-eastern counties of Scotland&mdash;Roxburgh, Berwick, Haddington,
Edinburgh, Linlithgow, Peebles and Selkirk&mdash;each of them being
treated of as regards name, situation and extent, natural objects,
antiquities, establishment as shires, civil history, agriculture,
manufactures and trade, and ecclesiastical history. In 1824,
after an interval of fourteen years, the third volume appeared,
giving, under the same headings, a description of the seven
south-western counties&mdash;Dumfries, Kirkcudbright, Wigtown,
Ayr, Lanark, Renfrew and Dumbarton. In the preface to this
volume the author states that the materials for the history of
the central and northern counties were collected, and that he
expected the work would be completed in two years, but this
expectation was not destined to be realized. He had also been
engaged on a history of Scottish poetry and a history of printing
in Scotland. Each of them he thought likely to extend to two
large quarto volumes, and on both he expended an unusual
amount of enthusiasm and energy. He had also prepared for the
press an elaborate history of the life and reign of David I. In
his later researches he was assisted by his nephew James, son of
Alexander Chalmers, writer in Elgin.</p>

<p>George Chalmers died in London on the 31st of May 1825.
His valuable and extensive library he bequeathed to his nephew,
at whose death in 1841 it was sold and dispersed. Chalmers was a
member of the Royal and Antiquarian Societies of London, an
honorary member of the Antiquarian Society of Scotland, and
a member of other learned societies. In private life he was
undoubtedly an amiable man, although the dogmatic tone that
disfigures portions of his writings procured him many opponents.
Among his avowed antagonists in literary warfare the most
distinguished were Malone and Steevens, the Shakespeare editors;
Mathias, the author of the <i>Pursuits of Literature</i>; Dr Jamieson,
the Scottish lexicographer; Pinkerton, the historian; Dr Irving,
the biographer of the Scottish poets; and Dr Currie of Liverpool,
But with all his failings in judgment Chalmers was a valuable
writer. He uniformly had recourse to original sources of information;
and he is entitled to great praise for his patriotic
and self-sacrificing endeavours to illustrate the history, literature
and antiquities of his native country.</p>

in the Glasgow City Mission he passed through Cheshunt College,
and, being accepted by the London Missionary Society, was
appointed to Rarotonga in the South Pacific in 1866. Here the
natives gave him the well-known name &ldquo;Tamate.&rdquo; After ten
years&rsquo; service, especially in training native evangelists, he was
transferred to New Guinea. In addition to his enthusiastic but
sane missionary work, Chalmers did much to open up the island,
and, with his colleague W.G. Lawes, gave valuable aid in the
British annexation of the south-east coast of the island. On
the 8th of April 1901, in company with a brother missionary,
Oliver Tomkins, he was killed by cannibals at Goaribari Island.

<p><span class="bold">CHALMERS, THOMAS<a name="ar97" id="ar97"></a></span> (1780-1847), Scottish divine, was born
at Anstruther in Fifeshire, on the 17th of March 1780. At the
age of eleven he was entered as a student at St Andrews, where he
devoted himself almost exclusively to mathematics. In January
1799 he was licensed as a preacher of the Gospel by the St
Andrews presbytery. In May 1803, after attending further
courses of lectures in Edinburgh, and acting as assistant to the
professor of mathematics at St Andrews, he was ordained as
minister of Kilmany in Fifeshire, about 9 m. from the university
town, where he continued to lecture. His mathematical lectures
roused so much enthusiasm that they were discontinued by order
of the authorities, who disliked the disturbance of the university
routine which they involved. Chalmers then opened mathematical
classes on his own account which attracted many students;
at the same time he delivered a course of lectures on chemistry,
and ministered to his parish at Kilmany. In 1805 he became a
candidate for the vacant professorship of mathematics at
Edinburgh, but was unsuccessful. In 1808 he published an
<i>Inquiry into the Extent and Stability of National Resources</i>, a
contribution to the discussion created by Bonaparte&rsquo;s commercial
policy. Domestic bereavements and a severe illness then turned
his thoughts in another direction. At his own request the article
on Christianity was assigned to him in Dr Brewster&rsquo;s <i>Edinburgh
Encyclopaedia</i>, and in studying the credentials of Christianity he
received a new impression of its contents. His journal and letters
show how he was led from a sustained effort to attain the morality
of the Gospel to a profound spiritual revolution. After this his
ministry was marked by a zeal which made it famous. The
separate publication of his article in the <i>Edinburgh Encyclopaedia</i>,
and contributions to the <i>Edinburgh Christian Instructor</i>
and the <i>Eclectic Review</i>, enhanced his reputation as an author.
In 1815 he became minister of the Tron Church, Glasgow, in
spite of determined opposition to him in the town council on the
ground of his evangelical teaching. From Glasgow his repute
as a preacher spread throughout the United Kingdom. A
series of sermons on the relation between the discoveries of
astronomy and the Christian revelation was published in January
1817, and within a year nine editions and 20,000 copies were in
circulation. When he visited London Wilberforce wrote, &ldquo;all
the world is wild about Dr Chalmers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In Glasgow Chalmers made one of his greatest contributions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page810" id="page810"></a>810</span>
to the life of his own time by his experiments in parochial organization.
His parish contained about 11,000 persons, and of
these about one-third were unconnected with any church. He
diagnosed this evil as being due to the absence of personal influence,
spiritual oversight, and the want of parochial organizations
which had not kept pace in the city, as they had done in rural
parishes, with the growing population. He declared that twenty
new churches, with parishes, should be erected in Glasgow, and
he set to work to revivify, remodel and extend the old parochial
economy of Scotland. The town council consented to build one
new church, attaching to it a parish of 10,000 persons, mostly
weavers, labourers and factory workers, and this church was
offered to Dr Chalmers that he might have a fair opportunity
of testing his system.</p>

<p>In September 1819 he became minister of the church and
parish of St John, where of 2000 families more than 800 had no
connexion with any Christian church. He first addressed himself
to providing schools for the children. Two school-houses
with four endowed teachers were established, where 700 children
were taught at the moderate fees of 2s. and 3s. per quarter.
Between 40 and 50 local Sabbath schools were opened, where
more than 1000 children were taught the elements of secular and
religious education. The parish was divided into 25 districts
embracing from 60 to 100 families, over each of which an elder
and a deacon were placed, the former taking oversight of their
spiritual, the latter of their physical needs. Chalmers was the
mainspring of the whole system, not merely superintending the
visitation, but personally visiting all the families, and holding
evening meetings, when he addressed those whom he had visited.
This parochial machinery enabled him to make a singularly
successful experiment in dealing with the problem of poverty.
At this time there were not more than 20 parishes north of the
Forth and Clyde where there was a compulsory assessment for
the poor, but the English method of assessment was rapidly
spreading. Chalmers believed that compulsory assessment
ended by swelling the evil it was intended to mitigate, and that
relief should be raised and administered by voluntary means.
His critics replied that this was impossible in large cities. When
he undertook the management of the parish of St John&rsquo;s, the
poor of the parish cost the city £1400 per annum, and in four
years, by the adoption of his method, the pauper expenditure
was reduced to £280 per annum. The investigation of all new
applications for relief was committed to the deacon of the district,
and every effort was made to enable the poor to help themselves.
When once the system was in operation it was found that a
deacon, by spending an hour a week among the families committed
to his charge, could keep himself acquainted with their
character and condition.</p>

<p>In 1823, after eight years of work at high pressure, he was glad
to accept the chair of moral philosophy at St Andrews, the
seventh academic offer made to him during his eight years in
Glasgow. In his lectures he excluded mental philosophy and
included the whole sphere of moral obligation, dealing with
man&rsquo;s duty to God and to his fellow-men in the light of Christian
teaching. Many of his lectures are printed in the first and
second volumes of his published works. In ethics he made contributions
to the science in regard to the place and functions of
volition and attention, the separate and underived character of
the moral sentiments, and the distinction between the virtues
of perfect and imperfect obligation. His lectures kindled the
religious spirit among his students, and led some of them to
devote themselves to missionary effort. In November 1828 he
was transferred to the chair of theology in Edinburgh. He then
introduced the practice of following the lecture with a viva voce
examination on what had been delivered. He also introduced
text-books, and came into stimulating contact with his people;
perhaps no one has ever succeeded as he did by the use of these
methods in communicating intellectual, moral and religious impulse
to so many students.</p>

<p>These academic years were prolific also in a literature of various
kinds. In 1826 he published a third volume of the <i>Christian and
Civic Economy of Large Towns</i>, a continuation of work begun
at St John&rsquo;s, Glasgow. In 1832 he published a <i>Political Economy</i>,
the chief purpose of which was to enforce the truth that the
right economic condition of the masses is dependent on their
right moral condition, that character is the parent of comfort,
not vice versa. In 1833 appeared a treatise on <i>The Adaptation of
External Nature to the Moral and Intellectual Constitution of Man</i>.
In 1834 Dr Chalmers was elected fellow of the Royal Society of
Edinburgh, and in the same year he became corresponding
member of the Institute of France; in 1835 Oxford conferred on
him the degree of D.C.L. In 1834 he became leader of the
evangelical section of the Scottish Church in the General
Assembly. He was appointed chairman of a committee for
church extension, and in that capacity made a tour through
a large part of Scotland, addressing presbyteries and holding
public meetings. He also issued numerous appeals, with the
result that in 1841, when he resigned his office as convener of the
church extension committee, he was able to announce that in
seven years upwards of £300,000 had been contributed, and 220
new churches had been built. His efforts to induce the Whig
government to assist in this effort were unsuccessful.</p>

<p>In 1841 the movement which ended in the Disruption was
rapidly culminating, and Dr Chalmers found himself at the
head of the party which stood for the principle that &ldquo;no minister
shall be intruded into any parish contrary to the will of the
congregation&rdquo; (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Free Church of Scotland</a></span>). Cases of conflict
between the church and the civil power arose in Auchterarder,
Dunkeld and Marnoch; and when the courts made it
clear that the church, in their opinion, held its temporalities
on condition of rendering such obedience as the courts required,
the church appealed to the government for relief. In January
1843 the government put a final and peremptory negative on
the church&rsquo;s claims for spiritual independence. On the 18th of
May 1843 470 clergymen withdrew from the general assembly
and constituted themselves the Free Church of Scotland, with
Dr Chalmers as moderator. He had prepared a sustentation
fund scheme for the support of the seceding ministers, and this
was at once put into successful operation. On the 30th of May
1847, immediately after his return from the House of Commons,
where he had given evidence as to the refusal of sites for Free
Churches by Scottish landowners, he was found dead in bed.</p>

<p>Dr Chalmers&rsquo; action throughout the Free Church controversy
was so consistent in its application of Christian principle and
so free from personal or party animus, that his writings are a
valuable source for argument and illustration on the question
of Establishment. &ldquo;I have no veneration,&rdquo; he said to the
royal commissioners in St Andrews, before either the voluntary
or the non-intrusive controversies had arisen, &ldquo;for the Church of
Scotland <i>qua</i> an establishment, but I have the utmost veneration
for it <i>qua</i> an instrument of Christian good.&rdquo; He was transparent
in character, chivalrous, kindly, firm, eloquent and sagacious;
his purity of motive and unselfishness commanded absolute confidence;
he had originality and initiative in dealing with new and
difficult circumstances, and great aptitude for business details.</p>

<p>During a life of incessant activity Chalmers scarcely ever
allowed a day to pass without its modicum of composition;
at the most unseasonable times, and in the most unlikely places,
he would occupy himself with literary work. His writings
occupy more than 30 volumes. He would have stood higher as
an author had he written less, or had he indulged less in that
practice of reiteration into which he was constantly betrayed by
his anxiety to impress his ideas upon others. As a political
economist he was the first to unfold the connexion that subsists
between the degree of the fertility of the soil and the social
condition of a community, the rapid manner in which capital
is reproduced (see Mill&rsquo;s <i>Political Economy</i>, i. 94), and the
general doctrine of a limit to all the modes by which national
wealth may accumulate. He was the first also to advance that
argument in favour of religious establishments which meets
upon its own ground the doctrine of Adam Smith, that religion
like other things should be left to the operation of the natural
law of supply and demand. In the department of natural
theology and the Christian evidences he ably advocated that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page811" id="page811"></a>811</span>
method of reconciling the Mosaic narrative with the indefinite
antiquity of the globe which William Buckland (1784-1856)
advanced in his Bridgewater Treatise, and which Dr Chalmers
had previously communicated to him. His refutation of Hume&rsquo;s
objection to the truth of miracles is perhaps his intellectual
<i>chef-d&rsquo;&oelig;uvre</i>. The distinction between the laws and dispositions
of matter, as between the ethics and objects of theology, he was
the first to indicate and enforce, and he laid great emphasis on
the superior authority as witnesses for the truth of Revelation of
the Scriptural as compared with the Extra-Scriptural writers, and
of the Christian as compared with the non-Christian testimonies.
In his <i>Institutes of Theology</i>, no material modification is attempted
on the doctrines of Calvinism, which he received with all simplicity
of faith as revealed in the Divine word, and defended as in
harmony with the most profound philosophy of human nature
and of the Divine providence.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHALONER, SIR THOMAS<a name="ar98" id="ar98"></a></span> (1521-1565), English statesman
and poet, was the son of Roger Chaloner, mercer of London,
a descendant of the Denbighshire Chaloners. No details are
known of his youth except that he was educated at both Oxford
and Cambridge. In 1540 he went, as secretary to Sir Henry
Knyvett, to the court of Charles V., whom he accompanied in
his expedition against Algiers in 1541, and was wrecked on the
Barbary coast. In 1547 he joined in the expedition to Scotland,
and was knighted, after the battle of Musselburgh, by the
protector Somerset, whose patronage he enjoyed. In 1549 he
was a witness against Dr Bonner, bishop of London; in 1551
against Stephen Gardiner, bishop of Winchester; in the spring
of the latter year he was sent as a commissioner to Scotland, and
again in March 1552. In 1553 he went with Sir Nicholas Wotton
and Sir William Pickering on an embassy to France, but was
recalled by Queen Mary on her accession. In spite of his Protestant
views, Chaloner was still employed by the government,
going to Scotland in 1555-1556, and providing carriages for
troops in the war with France, 1557-1558. In 1558 he went as
Elizabeth&rsquo;s ambassador to the emperor Ferdinand at Cambrai,
from July 1559 to February 1559/60 he was ambassador to
King Philip at Brussels, and in 1561 he went in the same capacity
to Spain. His letters are full of complaints of his treatment
there, but it was not till 1564, when in failing health, that he
was allowed to return home. He died at his house in Clerkenwell
on the 14th of October 1565. He acquired during his years of
service three estates, Guisborough in Yorkshire, Steeple Claydon
in Buckinghamshire, and St Bees in Cumberland. He married
(1) Joan, widow of Sir Thomas Leigh; and (2) Etheldreda, daughter
of Edward Frodsham, of Elton, Cheshire, by whom he had one
son, Sir Thomas Chaloner (1561-1615), the naturalist. Chaloner
was the intimate of most of the learned men of his day, and with
Lord Burghley he had a life-long friendship. Throughout his
busy official life he occupied himself with literature, his Latin
verses and his pastoral poems being much admired by his contemporaries.
Chaloner&rsquo;s &ldquo;Howe the Lorde Mowbray ... was ... banyshed
the Realme,&rdquo; printed in the 1559 edition of William
Baldwin&rsquo;s <i>Mirror for Magistrates</i> (repr. in vol. ii. pt. 1 of Joseph
Haslewood&rsquo;s edition of 1815), has sometimes been attributed
to Thomas Churchyard. His most important work, <i>De Rep.
Anglorum instauranda libri decem</i>, written while he was in Spain,
was first published by William Malim (1579, 3 pts.), with complimentary
Latin verses in praise of the author by Burghley and
others. Chaloner&rsquo;s epigrams and epitaphs were also added to
the volume, as well as <i>In laudem Henrici octavi ... carmen
Panegericum</i>, first printed in 1560. Amongst his other works
are <i>The praise of folie, Moriae encomium</i> ... by Erasmus.... Englished
by Sir Thomas Chaloner, Knight (1549, ed. Janet E.
Ashbee, 1901); <i>A book of the Office of Servantes</i> (1543), translated

surrounded by ample avenues and promenades, the park known
as the Jard, in the south-western quarter, being especially
attractive. Huge barracks lie to the north and east. There are
several interesting churches in the town. The cathedral of St
Étienne dates chiefly from the 13th century, but its west façade
is in the classical style and belongs to the 17th century. There
are stained-glass windows of the 13th century in the north
transept. Notre-Dame, of the 12th and 13th centuries, is conspicuous
for its four Romanesque towers, two flanking the apse;
the other two, surmounted by tall lead spires, flanking the
principal façade. The churches of St. Alpin, St Jean and St
Loup date from various periods between the 11th and the 17th
centuries. The hôtel-de-ville (1771), facing which stands a
monument to President Carnot; the prefecture (1750-1764), once
the residence of the intendants of Champagne; the college, once
a Jesuit establishment; and a training college which occupies
the Augustinian abbey of Toussaints (16th and 17th centuries),
are noteworthy civil buildings. The houses of Châlons are
generally ill-built of timber and plaster, or rough-cast, but some
old mansions, dating from the 15th to the 16th centuries, remain.
The church of Ste Pudentienne, on the left bank of the river, is a
well-known place of pilgrimage. The town is the seat of a bishop
and a prefect, and headquarters of the VI. army corps; it has
tribunals of first instance and of commerce, a chamber of
commerce, a board of trade-arbitrators, a museum, a library,
training colleges, a higher ecclesiastical seminary, a communal
college and an important technical school. The principal industry
is brewing, which is carried on in the suburb of Marne. Galleries
of immense length, hewn in a limestone hill and served by lines
of railway, are used as store-houses for beer. The preparation
of champagne, the manufacture of boots and shoes, brushes,
wire-goods and wall-paper also occupy many hands. There is
trade in cereals.</p>

<p>Châlons-sur-Marne occupies the site of the chief town of the
Catalauni, and some portion of the plains which lie between it
and Troyes was the scene of the defeat of Attila in the conflict
of 451. In the 10th and following centuries it attained great
prosperity as a kind of independent state under the supremacy
of its bishops, who were ecclesiastical peers of France. In 1214
the militia of Châlons served at the battle of Bouvines; and in
the 15th century the citizens maintained their honour by twice
(1430 and 1434) repulsing the English from their walls. In the
16th century the town sided with Henry IV., king of France,
who in 1589 transferred thither the parlement of Paris, which
shortly afterwards burnt the bulls of Gregory XIV. and Clement
VIII. In 1856 Napoleon III. established a large camp, known
as the Camp of Châlons, about 16 m. north of the town by the
railway to Reims. It was situated in the immediate neighbourhood
of Grand Mourmelon and Petit Mourmelon, and occupied
an area of nearly 30,000 acres. The &ldquo;Army of Châlons,&rdquo; formed
by Marshal MacMahon in the camp after the first reverses of the
French in 1870, marched thence to the Meuse, was surrounded
by the Germans at Sedan, and forced to capitulate. The camp
is still a training-centre for troops.</p>

<p>About 5 m. E. of Châlons is L&rsquo;Epine, where there is a beautiful
pilgrimage church (15th and 16th centuries, with modern restoration)
with a richly-sculptured portal. In the interior there is
a fine choir-screen, an organ of the 16th century, and an ancient
and much-venerated statue of the Virgin.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHALON-SUR-SAÔNE,<a name="ar100" id="ar100"></a></span> a town of east-central France, capital
of an arrondissement in the department of Saône-et-Loire,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page812" id="page812"></a>812</span>
81 m. N. of Lyons by the Paris-Lyon railway. Pop. (1906)
26,538. It is a well-built town, with fine quays, situated in an
extensive plain on the right bank of the Saône at its junction
with the Canal du Centre. A handsome stone bridge of the 15th
century, decorated in the 18th century with obelisks, connects
it with the suburb of St Laurent on an island in the river. The
principal building is the church of St Vincent, once the cathedral.
It dates mainly from the 12th to the 15th centuries, but the
façade is modern and unpleasing. The old bishop&rsquo;s palace is
a building of the 15th century. The church of St Pierre, with
two lofty steeples, dates from the late 17th century. Chalon preserves
remains of its ancient ramparts and a number of old houses.
The administrative buildings are modern. An obelisk was erected
in 1730 to commemorate the opening of the canal. There is a
statue of J.N. Niepce, a native of the town. Chalon is the seat
of a sub-prefect and a court of assizes, and there are tribunals
of first instance and commerce, a branch of the Bank of France,
a chamber of commerce, communal colleges for boys and girls,
a school of drawing, a public library and a museum. Chalon
ranks next to Le Creusot among the manufacturing towns of
Burgundy; its position at the junction of the Canal du Centre
and the Saône, and as a railway centre for Lyons, Paris, Dôle,
Lons-le-Saunier and Roanne, brings it a large transit trade. The
founding and working of copper and iron is its main industry;
the large engineering works of Petit-Creusot, a branch of those
of Le Creusot, construct bridges, tug-boats and torpedo-boats;
distilleries, glass-works, chemical works, straw-hat manufactories,
oil-works, tile-works and sugar refineries also occupy many
hands. Wine, grain, iron, leather and timber are among the
many products for which the town is an entrepôt. About 2 m.
east of Chalon is St Marcel (named after the saint who in the
2nd century preached Christianity at Chalon), which has a church
of the 12th century, once belonging to a famous abbey.</p>

<p>Chalon-sur-Saône is identified with the ancient <i>Cabillonum</i>,
originally an important town of the Aedui. It was chosen in
the 6th century by Gontram, king of Burgundy, as his capital;
and it continued till the 10th to pay for its importance by being
frequently sacked. The bishopric, founded in the 4th century, was
suppressed at the Revolution. In feudal times Chalon was the
capital of a countship. In 1237 it was given in exchange for other
fiefs in the Jura by Jean le Sage, whose descendants nevertheless
retained the title. Hugh IV., duke of Burgundy, the other
party to the exchange, gave the citizens a communal charter
in 1256. In its modern history the most important event was
the resistance offered to a division of the Austrian army in
1814.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHALUKYA,<a name="ar101" id="ar101"></a></span> the name of an Indian dynasty which ruled
in the Deccan from <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 550 to 750, and again from 973 to 1190.
The Chalukyas themselves claimed to be Rajputs from the north
who imposed their rule on the Dravidian inhabitants of the
Deccan tableland, and there is some evidence for connecting
them with the Chapas, a branch of the foreign Gurjaras. The
dynasty was founded by a chief named Pulakesin I., who
mastered the town of Vatapi (now Badami, in the Bijapur
district) about 550. His sons extended their principality east
and west; but the founder of the Chalukya greatness was his
grandson Pulakesin II., who succeeded in 608 and proceeded
to extend his rule at the expense of his neighbours. In 609 he
established as his viceroy in Vengi his brother Kubja Vishnuvardhana,
who in 615 declared his independence and established
the dynasty of Eastern Chalukyas, which lasted till 1070. In
620 Pulakesin defeated Harsha (<i>q.v.</i>), the powerful overlord of
northern India, and established the Nerbudda as the boundary
between the South and North. He also defeated in turn the
Chola, Pandya and Kerala kings, and by 630 was beyond
dispute the most powerful sovereign in the Deccan. In 642,
however, his capital was taken and he himself killed by the
Pallava king Narasimhavarman. In 655 the Chalukya power was
restored by Pulakesin&rsquo;s son Vikramaditya I.; but the struggle
with the Pallavas continued until, in 740, Vikramaditya II.
destroyed the Pallava capital. In 750 Vikramaditya&rsquo;s son,
Kirtivarman Chalukya, was overthrown by the Rashtrakutas.</p>

<p>In 973, Taila or Tailapa II. (d. 995), a scion of the royal
Chalukya race, succeeded in overthrowing the Rashtrakuta
king Kakka II., and in recovering all the ancient territory of
the Chalukyas with the exception of Gujarat. He was the founder
of the dynasty known as the Chalukyas of Kalyani. About <span class="scs">A.D.</span>
1000 a formidable invasion by the Chola king Rajaraja the
Great was defeated, and in 1052 Somesvara I., or Ahamavalla
(d. 1068), the founder of Kalyani, defeated and slew the Chola
Rajadhiraja. The reign of Vikramaditya VI., or Vikramanka,
which lasted from 1076 to 1126, formed another period of
Chalukya greatness. Vikramanka&rsquo;s exploits against the Hoysala
kings and others, celebrated by the poet Bilhana, were held to
justify him in establishing a new era dating from his accession.
With his death, however, the Chalukya power began to decline.
In 1156 the commander-in-chief Bijjala (or Vijjana) Kalachurya
revolted, and he and his sons held the kingdom till 1183. In
this year Somesvara IV. Chalukya recovered part of his patrimony,
only to succumb, about 1190, to the Yadavas of Devagiri
and the Hoysalas of Dorasamudra. Henceforth the Chalukya
rajas ranked only as petty chiefs.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHALYBÄUS, HEINRICH MORITZ<a name="ar102" id="ar102"></a></span> (1796-1862), German
philosopher, was born at Pfaffroda in Saxony. For some years
he taught at Dresden, and won a high reputation by his lectures
on the history of philosophy in Germany. In 1839 he became
professor in Kiel University, where, with the exception of one
brief interval, when he was expelled with several colleagues
because of his German sympathies, he remained till his death.
His first published work, <i>Historische Entwickelung der spekulativen
Philosophic von Kant bis Hegel</i> (1837, 5th ed. 1860), which
still ranks among the best expositions of modern German thought,
has been twice translated into English, by A. Tulk (London,
1854), and by A. Edersheim (Edinburgh, 1854). His chief works
are <i>Entwurf eines Systems der Wissenschaftslehre</i> (Kiel, 1846)
and <i>System der spekulativen Ethik</i> (2 vols., 1850). He opposed
both the extreme realism of Herbart and what he regarded as
the one-sided idealism of Hegel, and endeavoured to find a mean
between them, to discover the ideal or formal principle which
unfolds itself in the real or material world presented to it.
His <i>Wissenschaftslehre</i>, accordingly, divides itself into (1)
<i>Principlehre</i>, or theory of the one principle; (2) <i>Vermittelungslehre</i>,
or theory of the means by which this principle realizes
itself; and (3) <i>Teleologie</i>. The most noticeable point is the position
assigned by Chalybäus to the &ldquo;World Ether,&rdquo; which is defined
as the infinite in time and space, and which, he thinks, must
be posited as necessarily coexisting with the Infinite Spirit or
God. The fundamental principle of the <i>System der Ethik</i> is
carried out with great strength of thought, and with an unusually
complete command of ethical material.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHALYBITE,<a name="ar103" id="ar103"></a></span> a mineral species consisting of iron carbonate
(FeCO<span class="su">3</span>) and forming an important ore of iron. It was early
known as spathose iron, spathic iron or steel ore. F.S. Beudant
in 1832 gave the name siderose (from <span class="grk" title="sidêros">&#963;&#943;&#948;&#951;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span>, iron), which was
modified by W. Haidinger in 1845 to siderite. Chalybite (from
<span class="grk" title="chalyps">&#967;&#940;&#955;&#965;&#968;</span>, <span class="grk" title="chalybos">&#967;&#940;&#955;&#965;&#946;&#959;&#962;</span>, Lat. <i>chalybs</i>, steel) is of slightly later date,
having been given by E.F. Glocker in 1847. The name siderite
is in common use, but it is open to objection since it had earlier
been applied to several other species, and is also now used as a
group name for meteoric irons. Chalybite crystallizes in the
rhombohedral system and is isomorphous with calcite; like this
it possesses perfect cleavages parallel to the faces of the primitive
rhombohedron, the angles between which are 73° 0&prime;. Crystals
are usually rhombohedral in habit, and the primitive rhombohedron
<i>r</i>{100} is a common form, the faces being often curved
as represented in the figure. Acute rhombohedra in combination
with the basal pinacoid are also frequent, giving crystals of
octahedral aspect. The mineral often occurs in cleavable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page813" id="page813"></a>813</span>
masses with a coarse or fine granular texture; also in botryoidal
or globular (sphaerosiderite) and oolitic forms. When compact
and mixed with much clay and sand it constitutes the well-known
clay ironstone. Chalybite is usually yellowish-grey or
brown in colour; it is translucent and has a vitreous lustre.
Hardness 3½; sp. gr. 3.8. The double refraction (&omega; &minus; &epsilon; = 0.241)
is stronger than that of calcite. When pure it contains 48.2%
of iron, but this is often partly
replaced isomorphously by manganese,
magnesium or calcium: the
varieties known as oligon-spar or
oligonite, sideroplesite and siderodote
contain these elements respectively
in large amount. These
varieties form a passage to ankerite
(<i>q.v.</i>) and mesitite, and all are
referred to loosely as brown-spar.</p>

<p>Chalybite is a common gangue mineral in metalliferous veins,
and well-crystallized specimens are found with ores of copper,
lead, tin, &amp;c., in Cornwall, the Harz, Saxony and many other
places. It also occurs alone as large masses in veins and beds
in rocks of various kinds. The clay ironstone so extensively
worked as an ore of iron occurs as nodules and beds in the Coal
Measures of England and the United States, and the oolitic iron
ore of the Cleveland district in Yorkshire forms beds in the Lias.
The mineral is occasionally found as concretionary masses
(sphaerosiderite) in cavities in basic igneous rocks such as
dolerite.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAMBA,<a name="ar104" id="ar104"></a></span> a native state of India, within the Punjab, amid
the Himalayas, and lying on the southern border of Kashmir.
It has an area of 3216 sq. m. Pop. (1901) 127,834. The sanatorium
of Dalhousie, though within the state, is attached to the
district of Gurdaspur. Chamba is entirely mountainous; in
the east and north, and in the centre, are snowy ranges. The
valleys in the west and south are fertile. The chief rivers are the
Chandra and Ravi. The country is much in favour with sportsmen.
The principal crops are rice, maize and millet. Mineral
ores of various kinds are known, but unworked. Trade is
chiefly in forest produce. The capital of the state is Chamba
(pop. 6000), situated above the gorge of the Ravi. External
communications are entirely by road. The state was founded
in the 6th century, and, though sometimes nominally subject
to Kashmir and afterwards tributary to the Mogul empire,
always practically maintained its independence. Its chronicles
are preserved in a series of inscriptions, mostly engraved on
copper. It first came under British influence in 1846, when it
was declared independent of Kashmir. The line of the rajas of
Chamba was founded in the 6th century <span class="scs">A.D.</span> by Marut, of
an ancient family of Rajputs. In 1904 Bhuri Singh, K.C.S.I.,
C.I.E., an enlightened and capable ruler, succeeded.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAMBAL,<a name="ar105" id="ar105"></a></span> a river of India, one of the principal tributaries
of the Jumna. Rising amid the summits of the Vindhya
mountains in Malwa, it flows north, and after being joined by
the Chambla and Sipra, passes through the gorges of the Mokandarra
hills. After receiving the waters of the Kali-Sind, Parbati
and Banas, its principal confluents, the Chambal becomes a
great river, enters the British district of Etawah, and joins
the Jumna 40 m. below Etawah town, its total length being
650 m.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAMBERLAIN, JOSEPH<a name="ar106" id="ar106"></a></span> (1836-&emsp;&emsp;), British statesman,
third son of Joseph Chamberlain, master of the Cordwainers&rsquo;
Company, was born at Camberwell Grove, London, on the 8th
of July 1836. His father was a well-to-do man of business, a
Unitarian in religion and a Liberal in politics. Young Chamberlain
was educated at Canonbury from 1845 to 1850, and at
University College school, London, from 1850 to 1852. After
two years in his father&rsquo;s office in London, he was sent to Birmingham
to join his cousin Joseph Nettlefold in a screw business in
which his father had an interest; and by degrees, largely owing
to his own intelligent management, this business became very
successful. Nettlefold &amp; Chamberlain employed new methods
of attracting customers, and judiciously amalgamated rival
firms with their own so as to reduce competition, with the result
that in 1874, after twenty-two years of commercial life, Mr
Chamberlain was able to retire with an ample fortune. Meanwhile
he had in 1861 married his first wife, Miss Harriet Kenrick
(she died in 1863), and had gradually come to take an increasingly
important part in the municipal and political life of Birmingham.
He was a constant speaker at the Birmingham and Edgbaston
Debating Society; and when in 1868 the Birmingham Liberal
Association was reorganized, he became one of its leading
members. In 1869 he was elected chairman of the executive
council of the new National Education League, the outcome
of Mr George Dixon&rsquo;s movement for promoting the education
of the children of the lower classes by paying their school fees,
and agitating for more accommodation and a better national
system. In the same year he was elected a member of the town
council, and married his second wife&mdash;a cousin of his first&mdash;Miss
Florence Kenrick (d. 1875).</p>

<p>In 1870 he was elected a member of the first school board for
Birmingham; and for the next six years, and especially after
1873, when he became leader of a majority and chairman, he
actively championed the Nonconformist opposition to denominationalism.
He was then regarded as a Republican&mdash;the term
signifying rather that he held advanced Radical opinions, which
were construed by average men in the light of the current
political developments in France, than that he really favoured
Republican institutions. His programme was &ldquo;free Church,
free land, free schools, free labour.&rdquo; At the general election of
1874 he stood as a parliamentary candidate for Sheffield, but
without success. Between 1869 and 1873 he was a prominent
advocate in the Birmingham town council of the gospel of
municipal reform preached by Mr Dawson, Dr Dale and Mr
Bunce (of the <i>Birmingham. Post</i>); and in 1873 his party obtained
a majority, and he was elected mayor, an office he retained until
June 1876. As mayor he had to receive the prince and princess
of Wales on their visit in June 1874, an occasion which excited
some curiosity because of his reputation as a Republican; but
those who looked for an exhibition of bad taste were disappointed,
and the behaviour of the Radical mayor satisfied the requirements
alike of <i>The Times</i> and of <i>Punch</i>.</p>

<p>The period of his mayoralty was one of historic importance
in the growth of modern Birmingham. New municipal buildings
were erected, Highgate Park was opened as a place of recreation,
the free library and art gallery were developed. But the great
work carried through by Mr Chamberlain for Birmingham was
the municipalization of the supply of gas and water, and the
improvement scheme by which slums were cleared away and
forty acres laid out in new streets and open spaces. The prosperity
of modern Birmingham dates from 1875 and 1876, when
these admirably administered reforms were initiated, and by
his share in them Mr Chamberlain became not only one of its
most popular citizens but also a man of mark outside. An orator
of a business-like, straightforward type, cool and hard-hitting,
his spare figure, incisive features and single eye-glass soon made
him a favourite subject for the caricaturist; and in later life
his aggressive personality, and the peculiarly irritating effect it
had on his opponents, made his actions and speeches the object
of more controversy than was the lot of any other politician of
his time. His hobby for orchid-growing at his house &ldquo;Highbury&rdquo;
near Birmingham also became famous. In private life his loyalty
to his friends, and his &ldquo;genius for friendship&rdquo; (as John Morley
said) made a curious contrast to his capacity for arousing the
bitterest political hostility. It may be added here that the
interest taken by him in Birmingham remained undiminished
during his life, and he was largely instrumental in starting the
Birmingham University (1900), of which he became chancellor.
His connexion with Birmingham University was indeed peculiarly
appropriate to his character as a man of business; but in
spite of his representing a departure among men of the front
rank in politics from the &ldquo;Eton and Oxford&rdquo; type, his general
culture sometimes surprised those who did not know him.
In later life Oxford and Cambridge gave him their doctors&rsquo;
degrees; and in 1897 he was made lord rector of Glasgow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page814" id="page814"></a>814</span>
University (delivering an  address on  &ldquo;Patriotism&rdquo;  at  his
installation).</p>

<p>In 1876 Mr Dixon resigned his seat in parliament, and Mr
Chamberlain was returned for Birmingham in his place unopposed,
as John Bright&rsquo;s colleague. He made his maiden speech in the
House of Commons on the 4th of August 1876, on Lord Sandon&rsquo;s
Education Bill. At this period, too, he paid much attention
to the question of licensing reform, and in 1876 he examined the
Gothenburg system in Sweden, and advocated a solution of the
problem in England on similar lines. During 1877 the new
federation of Liberal Associations which became known as the
&ldquo;Caucus&rdquo; was started under Mr Chamberlain&rsquo;s influence in
Birmingham&mdash;its secretary, Mr Schnadhorst, quickly making
himself felt as a wire-puller of exceptional ability; and the new
organization had a remarkable effect in putting life into the
Liberal party, which since Mr Gladstone&rsquo;s retirement in 1874
had been much in need of a stimulus. When the general election
came in 1880, Mr Schnadhorst&rsquo;s powers were demonstrated in
the successes won under his auspices. The Liberal party numbered
349, against 243 Conservatives and 60 Irish Nationalists; and
the Radical section of the Liberal party, led by Mr Chamberlain
and Sir Charles Dilke, was recognized by Mr Gladstone by his
inclusion of the former in his cabinet as president of the Board
of Trade, and the appointment of the latter as under secretary for
foreign affairs. In his new capacity Mr Chamberlain was responsible
for carrying such important measures as the Bankruptcy
Act 1883, and the Patents Act. Another bill which he
had much at heart, on merchant shipping, had to be abandoned,
and a royal commission substituted, but the subsequent legislation
in 1888-1894 owed much to his efforts. The Franchise
Act of 1884 was also one in which he took a leading part as a
champion of the opinions of the labouring class. At this time
he took the current advanced Radical views of both Irish and
foreign policy, hating &ldquo;coercion,&rdquo; disliking the occupation of
Egypt, and prominently defending the Transvaal settlement after
Majuba. Both before and after the defeat of Mr Gladstone&rsquo;s
government on the Budget in June 1885, he associated himself
with what was known as the &ldquo;Unauthorized Programme,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>
free education, small holdings, graduated taxation and local
government. In June 1885 he made a speech at Birmingham,
treating the reforms just mentioned as the &ldquo;ransom&rdquo; that
property must pay to society for the security it enjoys&mdash;for
which Lord Iddesleigh called him &ldquo;Jack Cade&rdquo;; and he
continually urged the Liberal party to take up these Radical
measures. At the general election of November 1885 Mr
Chamberlain was returned for West Birmingham. The Liberal
strength generally was, however, reduced to 335 members,
though the Radical section held their own; and the Irish vote
became necessary to Mr Gladstone if he was to command a
majority. In December it was stated that Mr Gladstone intended
to propose Home Rule for Ireland, and in January Lord
Salisbury&rsquo;s ministry was defeated on the Address, on an amendment
moved by Mr Chamberlain&rsquo;s Birmingham henchman,
Mr Jesse Collings (b. 1831), embodying the &ldquo;three acres and a
cow&rdquo; of the Radical programme. Unlike Lord Hartington (afterwards
duke of Devonshire) and other Liberals, who declined to
join Mr Gladstone in view of the altered attitude he was adopting
towards Ireland, Mr Chamberlain entered the cabinet as president
of the Local Government Board (with Mr Jesse Collings
as parliamentary secretary), but on the 15th of March 1886 he
resigned, explaining in the House of Commons (8th April) that,
while he had always been in favour of the largest possible extension
of local government to Ireland consistently with the
integrity of the empire and the supremacy of parliament, and
had therefore joined Mr Gladstone when he believed that this
was what was intended, he was unable to consider that the
scheme communicated by Mr Gladstone to his colleagues maintained
those limitations. At the same time he was not irreconcilable,
and he invited Mr Gladstone even then to modify his bill
so as to remove the objections made to it. This indecisive
attitude did not last long, and the split in the party rapidly
widened. At Birmingham Mr Chamberlain was supported by
the &ldquo;Two Thousand,&rdquo; but deserted by the &ldquo;Caucus&rdquo; and Mr
Schnadhorst. In May the Radicals who followed Mr Bright
and Mr Chamberlain, and the Whigs who took their cue from
Lord Hartington, decided to vote against the second reading
of the Home Rule Bill, instead of allowing it to be taken and
then pressing for modifications in committee, and on 7th June
the bill was defeated by 343 to 313, 94 Liberal Unionists&mdash;as
they were generally called&mdash;voting against the government.
Mr Chamberlain was the object of the bitterest attacks from the
Gladstonians for his share in this result; he was stigmatized as
&ldquo;Judas,&rdquo; and open war was proclaimed by the Home Rulers
against the &ldquo;dissentient Liberals&rdquo;&mdash;the description used by Mr
Gladstone. The general election, however, returned to parliament
316 Conservatives, 78 Liberal Unionists, and only 276
Gladstonians and Nationalists, Birmingham returning seven
Unionist members. When the House met in August, it was
decided by the Liberal Unionists, under Lord Hartington&rsquo;s
leadership, that their policy henceforth was essentially to combine
with the Tories to keep Mr Gladstone out. The old Liberal feeling
still prevailing among them was too strong, however, for their
leaders to take office in a coalition ministry. It was enough for
them to be able to tie down the Conservative government to such
measures as were not offensive to Liberal Unionist principles.
It still seemed possible, moreover, that the Gladstonians might
be brought to modify their Home Rule proposals, and in January
1887 a Round Table conference (suggested by Mr Chamberlain)
was held between Mr Chamberlain, Sir G. Trevelyan, Sir William
Harcourt, Mr Morley and Lord Herschell. But no <i>rapprochement</i>
was effected, and reconciliation became daily more and
more difficult. The influence of Liberal Unionist views upon
the domestic legislation of the government was steadily bringing
about a more complete union in the Unionist party, and
destroying the old lines of political cleavage. Before 1892 Mr
Chamberlain had the satisfaction of seeing Lord Salisbury&rsquo;s
ministry pass such important acts, from a progressive point of
view, as those dealing with Coal Mines Regulation, Allotments,
County Councils, Housing of the Working Classes, Free Education
and Agricultural Holdings, besides Irish legislation like the
Ashbourne Act, the Land Act of 1891, and the Light Railways
and Congested Districts Acts. In October 1887 Mr Chamberlain,
Sir L. Sackville West and Sir Charles Tupper were selected by
the government as British plenipotentiaries to discuss with the
United States the Canadian fisheries dispute, and a treaty was
arranged by them at Washington on the 15th of February 1888.
The Senate refused to ratify it; but a protocol provided for a
<i>modus vivendi</i> pending ratification, giving American fishing vessels
similar advantages to those contemplated in the treaty; and on
the whole Mr Chamberlain&rsquo;s mission to America was accepted
as a successful one in maintaining satisfactory relations with the
United States. He returned to England in March 1888, and was
presented with the freedom of the borough of Birmingham. The
visit also resulted, in November 1888, in his marriage with his
third wife, Miss Endicott, daughter of the United States secretary
of war in President Cleveland&rsquo;s first administration.</p>

<p>At the general election of 1892 Mr Chamberlain was again
returned, with an increased majority, for West Birmingham;
but the Unionist party as a whole came back with only 315
members against 355 Home Rulers. In August Lord Salisbury&rsquo;s
ministry was defeated; and on the 13th of February 1893 Mr
Gladstone introduced his second Home Rule Bill, which was
eventually read a third time on the 1st of September. During
the eighty-two days&rsquo; discussion in the House of Commons Mr
Chamberlain was the life and soul of the opposition, and his
criticisms had a vital influence upon the attitude of the country
when the House of Lords summarily threw out the bill. His
chief contribution to the discussions during the later stages of
the Gladstone and Rosebery ministries was in connexion with
Mr Asquith&rsquo;s abortive Employers&rsquo; Liability Bill, when he foreshadowed
the method of dealing with this question afterwards
carried out in the Compensation Act of 1897. Outside parliament
he was busy formulating proposals for old age pensions, which
had a prominent place in the Unionist programme of 1895. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page815" id="page815"></a>815</span>
that year, on the defeat of Lord Rosebery, the union of the
Unionists was sealed by the inclusion of the Liberal Unionist
leaders in Lord Salisbury&rsquo;s ministry; and Mr Chamberlain
became secretary of state for the colonies. There had been much
speculation as to what his post would be, and his nomination
to the colonial office, then considered one of secondary rank,
excited some surprise; but Mr Chamberlain himself realized
how important that department had become. He carried with
him into the ministry his close Birmingham municipal associates,
Mr Jesse Collings (as under secretary of the home office), and Mr
J. Powell-Williams (1840-1904) as financial secretary to the war
office. Mr Chamberlain&rsquo;s influence in the Unionist cabinet was
soon visible in the Workmen&rsquo;s Compensation Act and other
measures. This act, though in Sir Matthew White Ridley&rsquo;s charge
as home secretary, was universally and rightly associated with
Mr Chamberlain; and its passage, in the face of much interested
opposition from highly-placed, old-fashioned conservatives and
capitalists on both sides, was principally due to his determined
advocacy. Another &ldquo;social&rdquo; measure of less importance, which
formed part of the Chamberlain programme, was the Small
Houses Acquisition Act of 1899; but the problem of old age
pensions was less easily solved. This subject had been handed
over in 1893 to a royal commission, and further discussed by a
select committee in 1899 and a departmental committee in 1900,
but both of these threw cold water on the schemes laid before
them&mdash;a result which, galling enough to one who had made so
much play with the question in the country, offered welcome
material to his opponents for electioneering recrimination, as
year by year went by between 1895 and 1900 and nothing resulted
from all the confident talk on the subject in which Mr
Chamberlain had indulged when out of office. Eventually it
was the Liberal and not the Unionist party that carried an Old
Age Pensions scheme through parliament, during the 1908
session, when Mr Chamberlain was <i>hors de combat</i>.</p>

<p>From January 1896 (the date of the Jameson Raid) onwards
South Africa demanded the chief attention of the colonial
secretary (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">South Africa</a></span>, and for details <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Transvaal</a></span>). In
his negotiations with President Kruger one masterful temperament
was pitted against another. Mr Chamberlain had a very
difficult part to play, in a situation dominated by suspicion on
both sides, and while he firmly insisted on the rights of Great
Britain and of British subjects in the Transvaal, he was the
continual object of Radical criticism at home. Never has a
statesman&rsquo;s personality been more bitterly associated by his
political opponents with the developments they deplored.
Attempts were even made to ascribe financial motives to Mr
Chamberlain&rsquo;s actions, and the political atmosphere was thick
with suspicion and scandal. The report of the Commons committee
(July 1897) definitely acquitted both Mr Chamberlain
and the colonial office of any privity in the Jameson Raid, but
Mr Chamberlain&rsquo;s detractors continued to assert the contrary.
Opposition hostility reached such a pitch that in 1899 there was
hardly an act of the cabinet during the negotiations with President
Kruger which was not attributed to the personal malignity
and unscrupulousness of the colonial secretary. The elections of
1900 (when he was again returned, unopposed, for West Birmingham)
turned upon the individuality of a single minister more
than any since the days of Mr Gladstone&rsquo;s ascendancy, and Mr
Chamberlain, never conspicuous for inclination to turn his other
cheek to the smiter, was not slow to return the blows with interest.</p>

<p>Apart from South Africa, his most important work at this time
was the successful passing of the Australian Commonwealth Act
(1900), in which both tact and firmness were needed to settle
certain differences between the imperial government and the
colonial delegates.</p>

<p>Mr Chamberlain&rsquo;s tenure of the office of colonial secretary
between 1895 and 1900 must always be regarded as a turning-point
in the history of the relations between the British colonies
and the mother country. His accession to office was marked by
speeches breathing a new spirit of imperial consolidation, embodied
either in suggestions for commercial union or in more
immediately practicable proposals for improving the &ldquo;imperial
estate&rdquo;; and at the Diamond Jubilee of 1897 the visits of the
colonial premiers to London emphasized and confirmed the new
policy, the fruits of which were afterwards seen in the cordial
support given by the colonies in the Boer War. Even in what
Mr Chamberlain called his &ldquo;Radical days&rdquo; he had never
supported the &ldquo;Manchester&rdquo; view of the value of a colonial
empire; and during the Gladstone ministry of 1882-1885 Mr
Bright had remarked that the junior member for Birmingham
was the only Jingo in the cabinet&mdash;meaning, no doubt, that
he objected to the policy of <i>laissez-faire</i> and the timidity of
what was afterwards known as &ldquo;Little Englandism.&rdquo; While he was
still under Mr Gladstone&rsquo;s influence these opinions were kept in
subordination; but Mr Chamberlain was always an imperial
federationist, and from 1887 onwards he constantly gave expression
to his views on the desirability of drawing the different
parts of the empire closer together for purposes of defence and
commerce. In 1895 the time for the realization of these views
had come; and Mr Chamberlain&rsquo;s speeches, previously remarkable
chiefly for debating power and directness of argument,
were now dominated by a new note of constructive statesmanship,
basing itself on the economic necessities of a world-wide empire.
Not the least of the anxieties of the colonial office during this
period was the situation in the West Indies, where the cane-sugar
industry was being steadily undermined by the European
bounties given to exports of continental beet; and though the
government restricted themselves to attempts at removing the
bounties by negotiation and to measures for palliating the worst
effects in the West Indies, Mr Chamberlain made no secret of his
repudiation of the Cobden Club view that retaliation would be
contrary to the doctrines of free trade, and he did his utmost
to educate public opinion at home into understanding that the
responsibilities of the mother country are not merely to be construed
according to the selfish interests of a nation of consumers.
As regards foreign affairs, Mr Chamberlain more than once (and
particularly at Leicester on 30th November 1899) indicated his
leanings towards a closer understanding between the British
empire, the United States and Germany,&mdash;a suggestion which
did not save him from an extravagant outburst of German
hostility during the Boer War. The unusually outspoken and
pointed expression, however, of his disinclination to submit to
Muscovite duplicity or to &ldquo;pin-pricks&rdquo; or &ldquo;unmannerliness&rdquo;
from France was criticized on the score of discretion by a wider
circle than that of his political adversaries.</p>

<p>During the progress of the Boer War from 1899 to 1902, Mr
Chamberlain, as the statesman who had represented the cabinet
in the negotiations which led to it, remained the object of constant
attacks from his Radical opponents&mdash;the &ldquo;little Englanders&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Pro-Boers,&rdquo; as he called them&mdash;and he was supported by
the Imperialist and Unionist party with at least equal ardour.
But as colonial secretary, except in so far as his consistent
support of Lord Milner and his enthusiastic encouragement of
colonial assistance were concerned, he naturally played only a
subordinate part during the carrying out of the military operations.
Among domestic statesmen he was felt, however, to be the
backbone of the party in power. He was the hero of the one
side, just as he was the bugbear of the other. On the 13th of
February 1902 he was presented with an address in a gold casket
by the city corporation, and entertained at luncheon at the
Mansion House, an honour not unconnected with the strong
feeling recently aroused by his firm reply (at Birmingham,
January 11) to some remarks made by Count von Büllow, the
German chancellor, in the Reichstag (January 8), reflecting the
offensive allegations current in Germany against the conduct
of the army in South Africa. Mr Chamberlain&rsquo;s speech, in answer
to what had been intended as a contemptuous rebuke, was universally
applauded. His own imperialism was intensified by the
way in which England&rsquo;s difficulties resulted in calling forth
colonial assistance and so cementing the bonds of empire. The
domestic crisis, and the sharp cleavage between parties at home,
had driven the bent of his mind and policy further and further
away from the purely municipal and national ideals which he
had followed so keenly before he became colonial minister. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page816" id="page816"></a>816</span>
problems of empire engrossed him, and a new enthusiasm for
imperial projects arose in the Unionist party under his inspiration.
No English statesman probably has ever been, at different
times in his career, so able an advocate of absolutely contradictory
policies, and his opponents were not slow to taunt him
with quotations from his earlier speeches. As the war drew to
its end, new plans for imperial consolidation were maturing in
his brain. Subsidiary points of utility, such as the formation of
the London and Liverpool schools of tropical medicine from 1899
onwards, were taken up by him with characteristic vigour.
But the next step was to prove a critical one indeed for the
loyalty of the party which had so far been unanimous in his
favour.</p>

<p>The settlement after the war was full of difficulties, financial
and others, in South Africa. When Mr Arthur Balfour succeeded
Lord Salisbury as prime minister in July 1902, Mr Chamberlain
agreed to serve loyally under him, and the friendship between
the two leaders was indeed one of the most marked features of the
political situation. In November 1902 it was arranged that Mr
Chamberlain should go out to South Africa, and it was hoped,
not without reason, that his personality would effect more good
than any ordinary official negotiations. At the time the best
results appeared to be secured. He went from place to place in
South Africa (December 26-February 25); arranged with the
leading Transvaal financiers that in return for support from the
British government in raising a Transvaal loan they would
guarantee a large proportion of a Transvaal debt of £30,000,000,
which should repay the British treasury so much of the cost of
the war; and when he returned in March 1903, satisfaction was
general in the country over the success of his mission. But
meantime two things had happened. He had looked at the
empire from the colonial point of view, in a way only possible
in a colonial atmosphere; and at home some of his colleagues
had gone a long way, behind the scenes, to destroy one of the
very factors on which the question of a practical scheme for
imperial commercial federation seemed to hinge. In the budget
of 1902 a duty of a shilling a quarter on imported corn had been
reintroduced. This small tax was regarded as only a registration
duty. Even by free-trade ministers like Gladstone it had been
left up to 1869 untouched, and its removal by Robert Lowe
(Lord Sherbrooke) had since then been widely regarded as a
piece of economic pedantry. Its reimposition, officially supported
for the sake of necessary revenue in war-time, and
cordially welcomed by the Unionist party, had justified itself,
as they contended, in spite of the criticisms of the Opposition
(who raised the cry of the &ldquo;dear loaf&rdquo;), by proving during the
year to have had no general or direct effect on the price of bread.
And the more advanced Imperialists, as well as the more old-fashioned
protectionists (like Mr Chaplin) who formed an integral
body of the Conservative party, had looked forward to this
tax being converted into a differential one between foreign and
colonial corn, so as to introduce a scheme of colonial preference
and commercial consolidation between the colonies and the
mother country. In South Africa&mdash;as in any other British
colony, since all of them were accustomed to tariffs of a protectionist
nature, and the idea of a preference (already started by
Canada) was fairly popular&mdash;Mr Chamberlain had found this
view well established. The agitation in England against the
tax had now blown over. The Unionist rank and file were
committed to its support,&mdash;many even advocating its increase
to two shillings at least. But Mr Ritchie, the chancellor of the
exchequer, having a surplus in prospect and taxation to take off,
carried the cabinet in favour of again remitting this tax on corn.
Mr Chamberlain himself had proposed only to take it off as
regards colonial, and not foreign corn,&mdash;thus inaugurating a
preferential system. But a majority of the cabinet supported
Mr Ritchie. The remission of this tax, after all the conviction
with which its restoration had been supported a year before,
was very difficult for the party itself to stomach, and on any
ground it was a distasteful act, loyally as the party followed
their leaders. But to those who had looked to it as providing
a lever for a gradual change in the established fiscal system,
the <i>volte-face</i> was a bitter blow, and at once there began, though
not at first openly, a split between the more rigid free-traders&mdash;advocates
of cheap food and free imports&mdash;and those who
desired to use the opportunities of a tariff, of however moderate
a kind, for attaining national and imperial and not merely
revenue advantages. This idea, which had for some time been
floating in Mr Chamberlain&rsquo;s mind (see especially his speech
at Birmingham of May 16, 1902), now took full possession of it.
For the moment he remained in the cabinet, but the seed of
dissension was sown. The first public intimation of his views
was given in a speech to his constituents at Birmingham (May 15,
1903), when he outlined a plan for raising more money by a
rearranged tariff, partly to obtain a preferential system for the
empire and partly to produce funds for social reform at home.
On May 28th in the House of Commons he spoke on the same
subject, and declared &ldquo;if you are to give a preference to the
colonies, you must put a tax on food.&rdquo; Considered in the light
of after events, this putting the necessity of food-taxes in the
forefront was decidedly injudicious; but imperialist conviction
and enthusiasm were more conspicuous than electioneering tact
in the launching of Mr Chamberlain&rsquo;s new scheme.</p>

<p>The movement grew quickly, its supporters including a
number of the cleverest younger politicians and journalists in
the Unionist party. The idea of tariff reform&mdash;to broaden the
basis of taxation, to introduce a preference, and to stimulate
home industries and increase employment&mdash;took firm root;
and the political economists of the party&mdash;Prof. W. Cunningham,
Prof. W. Ashley and Prof. W.A.S. Hewins, in particular&mdash;brought
effective criticism to bear on the one-sided &ldquo;free trade&rdquo;
in vogue. The first demand was for inquiry. The country was
still bearing an income-tax of elevenpence in the pound; it
appeared that the old sources of revenue were inadequate; and
meanwhile the statistics of trade, it was argued, showed that
the English free-import system hampered English trade while
providing the foreigner with a free market. Mr Chamberlain
and his supporters argued that since 1870 certain other countries
(Germany and the United States), with protective tariffs, had
increased their trade in much larger proportion, while English
trade had only been maintained by the increased business done
with British colonies. A scientific inquiry into the facts was
needed. By the Opposition, who now found themselves the
defenders of conservatism in the established fiscal policy of the
country, this whole argument was scouted; but for a time the
demand merely for inquiry, and the production of figures, gave
no sufficient occasion for dissension among Unionists, even when,
like Sir M. Hicks Beach, they were convinced free-importers
on purely economic grounds; and Mr Balfour (<i>q.v.</i>), as premier,
managed to hold his colleagues and party together by taking the
line that particular opinions on economic subjects should not
be made a test of party loyalty. The Board of Trade was set
to work to produce fiscal Blue-books, and hum-drum politicians
who had never shown any genius for figures suddenly blossomed
out into arithmeticians of the deepest dye. The Tariff Reform
League was founded in order to further Mr Chamberlain&rsquo;s
policy, holding its inaugural meeting on July 21st; and it
began to take an active part in issuing leaflets and in work at
by-elections. Discussion proceeded hotly on the merits of a
preferential tariff, and on August 15th a manifesto appeared
against it signed by fourteen professors or lecturers on political
economy, including Mr Leonard Courtney, Professor Edgeworth,
Professor Marshall, Professor Bastable, Professor Smart,
Professor J.S. Nicholson, Professor Conner, Mr Bowley, Mr E.
Cannan and Mr L.R. Phelps,&mdash;men of admitted competence,
yet, after all, of no higher authority than the economists supporting
Mr Chamberlain, such as Dr Cunningham and Professor
Ashley.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the death of Lord Salisbury (August 22) removed
a weighty figure from the councils of the Unionist party. The
cabinet met several times at the beginning of September, and
the question of their attitude towards the fiscal problem became
acute. The public had its first intimation of impending events
in the appearance on September 16th of Mr Balfour&rsquo;s <i>Economic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page817" id="page817"></a>817</span>
Notes on Insular Free Trade</i>, which had been previously circulated
as a cabinet memorandum. The next day appeared
the Board of Trade Fiscal Blue-book. And on the 18th the
resignations were announced, not only of the more rigid free-traders
in the cabinet, Mr Ritchie and Lord George Hamilton,
but also of Mr Chamberlain. Letters in cordial terms were
published, which had passed between Mr Chamberlain (September
9) and Mr Balfour (September 16). Mr Chamberlain pointed
out that he was committed to a preferential scheme involving
new duties on food, and could not remain in the government
without prejudice while it was excluded from the party programme;
remaining loyal to Mr Balfour and his general objects,
he could best promote this course from outside, and he suggested
that the government might confine its policy to the &ldquo;assertion
of our freedom in the case of all commercial relations with
foreign countries.&rdquo; Mr Balfour, while reluctantly admitting
the necessity of Mr Chamberlain&rsquo;s taking a freer hand, expressed
his agreement in the desirability of a closer fiscal union with the
colonies, but questioned the immediate practicability of any
scheme; he was willing to adopt fiscal reform so far as it covered
retaliatory duties, but thought that the exclusion of taxation
of food from the party programme was in existing circumstances
necessary, so long as public opinion was not ripe. At the same
time he welcomed the fact that Mr Chamberlain&rsquo;s son, Mr
Austen Chamberlain, was ready to remain a member of the
government. Mr Austen Chamberlain (b. 1863) accordingly
became the new chancellor of the exchequer; he was already
in the cabinet as postmaster-general, having previously made
his mark as civil lord of the admiralty (1895-1900), and financial
secretary to the treasury (1900-1902).</p>

<p>From the turning-point of Mr Chamberlain&rsquo;s resignation, it is
not necessary here to follow in detail the discussions and dissensions
in the party as a whole in its relations with the prime
minister (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Balfour, A.J.</a></span>). It is sufficient to say that while
Mr Balfour&rsquo;s sympathetic &ldquo;send off&rdquo; appeared to indicate his
inclination towards Mr Chamberlain&rsquo;s programme, if only further
support could be gained for it, his endeavour to keep the party
together, and the violent opposition which gathered against
Mr Chamberlain&rsquo;s scheme, combined to make his real attitude
during the next two years decidedly obscure, both sections of the
party&mdash;free-traders and tariff reformers&mdash;being induced from
time to time to regard him as on their side. The tariff reform
movement itself was now, however, outside the purely official
programme, and Mr Chamberlain (backed by a majority of the
Unionist members) threw himself with impetuous ardour into a
crusade on its behalf, while at the same time supporting Mr
Balfour in parliament, and leaving it to him to decide as to the
policy of going to the country when the time should be ripe.
In his own words, he went in front of the Unionist army as a
pioneer, and if his army was attacked he would go back to it; in
no conceivable circumstances would he allow himself to be put in
any sort of competition, direct or indirect, with Mr Balfour, his
friend and leader, whom he meant to follow (October 6).</p>

<p>On October 6th he opened his campaign with a speech at
Glasgow. Analysing the trade statistics as between 1872 and
1902, he insisted that British progress involved a relative decline
compared with that of protectionist foreign countries like Germany
and the United States; Great Britain exported less and
less of manufactured goods, and imported more and more; the
exports to foreign countries had decreased, and it was only the
increased exports to the colonies that maintained the British
position. This was the outcome of the working of a one-sided
free-trade system. Now was the time, and it might soon be lost,
for consolidating British trade relations with the colonies.
If the mother country and her daughter states did not draw
closer, they would inevitably drift apart. A further increase of
£26,000,000 a year in the trade with the colonies might be
obtained by a preferential tariff, and this meant additional
employment at home for 166,000 workmen, or subsistence for a
population of a far larger number. His positive proposals were:
(1) no tax on raw materials; (2) a small tax on food other than
colonial, <i>e.g.</i> two shillings a quarter on foreign corn but excepting
maize, and 5% on meat and dairy produce excluding bacon; (3)
a 10% general tariff on imported manufactured goods. To meet
any increased cost of living, he proposed to reduce the duties on
tea, sugar and other articles of general consumption, and he
estimated that his scheme would in no case increase a working-man&rsquo;s
expenditure, and in most cases would reduce it. &ldquo;The
colonies,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are prepared to meet us; in return for a very
moderate preference, they will give us a substantial advantage
in their markets.&rdquo; This speech, delivered with characteristic
vigour and Imperialistic enthusiasm, was the type of others
which followed in quick succession during the year. At Greenock
next day he emphasized the necessity of retaliating against
foreign tariffs&mdash;&ldquo;I never like being hit without striking back.&rdquo;
The practice of &ldquo;dumping&rdquo; must be fairly met; if foreign goods
were brought into England to undersell British manufacturers,
either the Fair Wages Clause and the Factory Acts and the Compensation
Act would have to be repealed, or the workmen would
have to take lower wages, or lose their work. &ldquo;Agriculture has
been practically destroyed, sugar has gone, silk has gone, iron is
threatened, wool is threatened, cotton will go! How long are
you going to stand it?&rdquo; On October 20th he spoke at Newcastle,
on the 21st at Tynemouth, on the 27th at Liverpool,
insisting that free-trade had never been a working-class measure
and that it could not be reconciled with trade-unionism; on
November 4th at Birmingham, on the 20th at Cardiff, on the
21st at Newport, and on December 16th at Leeds. In all these
speeches he managed to point his argument by application to
local industries. In the Leeds speech he announced that, with a
view to drawing up a scientific model tariff, a non-political
commission of representative experts would be appointed under
the auspices of the Tariff Reform League to take evidence from
every trade; it included many heads of businesses, and Mr Charles
Booth, the eminent student of social and industrial London, with
Sir Robert Herbert as chairman, and Professor W.A.S. Hewins
as secretary. The name of &ldquo;Tariff Commission,&rdquo; given to this
voluntary and unofficial body, was a good deal criticized, but
though flouted by the political free-traders it set to work in
earnest, and accumulated a mass of evidence as to the real facts
of trade, which promised to be invaluable to economic inquirers.
On January 18th, 1904, Mr Chamberlain ended his series of
speeches by a great meeting at the Guildhall, in the city of
London, the key-note being his exhortation to his audience to
&ldquo;think imperially.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All this activity on Mr Chamberlain&rsquo;s part represented a great
physical and intellectual feat on the part of a man now sixty-seven
years of age; but his bodily vigour and comparatively
youthful appearance were essential features of his personality.
Nothing like this campaign had been known in the political world
since Mr Gladstone&rsquo;s Midlothian days; and it produced a great
public impression, stirring up both supporters and opponents.
Free-trade unionists like Lord Goschen and Lord Hugh Cecil, and
the Liberal leaders&mdash;for whom Mr Asquith became the principal
spokesman, though Lord Rosebery&rsquo;s criticisms also had considerable
weight&mdash;found new matter in Mr Chamberlain&rsquo;s speeches
for their contention that any radical change in the traditional
English fiscal policy, established now for sixty years, would only
result in evil. The broad fact remained that while Mr Chamberlain&rsquo;s
activity gathered round him the bulk of the Unionist
members and an enthusiastic band of economic sympathizers,
the country as a whole remained apathetic and unconvinced.
One reason was the intellectual difficulty of the subject and the
double-faced character of all arguments from statistics, which
were either incomprehensible or disputable; another was the
fact that substantially this was a political movement, and that
tariff reform was, after all, only one in a complexity of political
issues, most of which during this period were being interpreted
by the electorate in a sense hostile to the Unionist party. Mr
Chamberlain had relied on his personal influence, which from
1895 to 1902 had been supreme; but his own resignation, and the
course of events, had since 1903 made his personality less authoritative,
and new interests&mdash;such as the opposition to the Education
Act, to the heavy taxation, and to Chinese labour in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page818" id="page818"></a>818</span>
Transvaal, and indignation over the revelations concerned with
the war&mdash;were monopolizing attention, to the weakening of his
hold on the public. The revival in trade, and the production of
new statistics which appeared to stultify Mr Chamberlain&rsquo;s
prophecies of progressive decline, enabled the free-trade
champions to reassure their audiences as to the very foundation
of his case, and to represent the whole tariff reform movement as
no less unnecessary than risky. Moreover, the split in the
Unionist party brought the united Liberal party in full force into
the field, and at last the country began to think that the danger
of Irish Home Rule was practically over, and that a Liberal
majority might be returned to power in safety, with the prospect
of providing an alternative government which would assure
commercial repose (Lord Rosebery&rsquo;s phrase), relief from extravagant
expenditure, and&mdash;as the working-classes were led to
believe&mdash;a certain amount of labour legislation which the Tory
leaders would never propose. On the other hand the colonies
took a great interest in the new movement, though without
putting any such pressure on the home public as Mr Chamberlain
might have expected. At the opening of 1904 he was officially
invited by Mr Deakin, the prime minister of the Commonwealth,
to pay a visit to Australia, in order to expound his scheme,
being promised an enthusiastic welcome &ldquo;as the harbinger of
commercial reciprocity between the mother country and her
colonies.&rdquo; Mr Chamberlain, however, declined; his work at
home was too pressing.</p>

<p>From the end of Mr Chamberlain&rsquo;s series of expository speeches
on his scheme of tariff reform, onwards during the various fiscal
debates and discussions of 1904, it is unnecessary to follow
events in detail. The scheme was now before the country, and
Mr Chamberlain was anxious to take its verdict. Time was not
on his side at his age, and if he had to be beaten at one election
he was anxious to get rid of the other issues which would encumber
the popular vote, and to press on to a second when he would
be on the attacking side. But he would make no move which
would embarrass Mr Balfour in parliament, and adhered to his
promise of loyalty. The result was a long drawn out interval,
while the government held on and its supporters became more
embittered over their differences. Mr Chamberlain needed a rest,
and was away in Italy and Egypt from March to May, and again
in November. He made three important speeches at Welbeck
(August 4), at Luton (October 5), and at Limehouse (December
15), but he had nothing substantial to add to his case, and
the party situation continued in all its embarrassments. Mr
Balfour&rsquo;s introduction of his promise (at Edinburgh on October 3)
to convene an imperial conference after the general election if the
Unionists came back to power, in order to discuss a scheme for
fiscal union, represented an academic rather than a practical
advance, since the by-elections showed that the Unionists were
certain to be defeated. The one important new development
concerned the Liberal-Unionist organization. In January some
correspondence was published between Mr Chamberlain and
the duke of Devonshire, dating from the previous October, as
to difficulties arising from the central Liberal-Unionist organization
subsidizing local associations which had adopted the programme
of tariff reform. The duke objected to this departure
from neutrality, and suggested that it was becoming &ldquo;impossible
with any advantage to maintain under existing circumstances
the existence of the Liberal-Unionist organization.&rdquo; Mr Chamberlain
retorted that this was a matter for a general meeting of
delegates to decide; if the duke was outvoted he might resign
his presidency; for his own part he was prepared to allow the
local associations to be subsidized impartially, so long as they
supported the government, but he was not prepared for the
violent disruption, which the duke apparently contemplated,
of an association so necessary to the success of the Unionist
cause. The duke was in a difficult position as president of the
organization, since most of the local associations supported
Mr Chamberlain, and he replied that the differences between
them were vital, and he would not be responsible for dividing
the association into sections, but would rather resign. Mr
Chamberlain then called a general meeting on his own responsibility
in February, when a new constitution was proposed;
and in May, at the annual meeting of the Liberal-Unionist council,
the free-food Unionists, being in a minority, retired, and the
association was reorganized under Mr Chamberlain&rsquo;s auspices,
Lord Lansdowne and Lord Selborne (both of them cabinet
ministers) becoming vice-presidents. On July 14th the reconstituted
Liberal-Unionist organization held a great demonstration
in the Albert Hall, and Mr Chamberlain&rsquo;s success in ousting
the duke of Devonshire and the other free-trade members of
the old Liberal-Unionist party, and imposing his own fiscal
policy upon the Liberal-Unionist caucus, was now complete.</p>

<p>During the spring and summer of 1905 Mr Chamberlain&rsquo;s
more active supporters were in favour of forcing a dissolution
by leaving the government in a minority, but he himself preferred
to leave matters to take their course, so long as the prime minister
was content to be publicly identified with the policy of eventually
fighting on tariff reform lines. Speaking at the Albert Hall in
July Mr Chamberlain pushed somewhat further than before
his &ldquo;embrace&rdquo; of Mr Balfour; and in the autumn, when foreign
affairs no longer dominated the attention of the government,
the crisis rapidly came to a head. In reply to Mr Balfour&rsquo;s
appeal for the sinking of differences (Newcastle, November 14),
Mr Chamberlain insisted at Bristol (November 21) on the adoption
of his fiscal policy; and Mr Balfour resigned on December 4.
on the ground that he no longer retained the confidence of the
party. At the crushing Unionist defeat in the general election
which followed in January 1906, Mr Chamberlain was triumphantly
returned for West Birmingham, and all the divisions of
Birmingham returned Chamberlainite members. Amid the wreck
of the party&mdash;Mr Balfour and several of his colleagues themselves
losing their seats&mdash;he had the consolation of knowing that the
tariff reformers won the only conspicuous successes of the election.
But he had no desire to set himself up as leader in Mr Balfour&rsquo;s
place, and after private negotiations with the ex-prime minister,
a common platform was arranged between them, on which
Mr Balfour, for whom a seat was found in the City of London,
should continue to lead the remnant of the party. The formula
was given in a letter from Mr Balfour of February 14th (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Balfour, A.J.</a></span>) which admitted the necessity of making fiscal
reform the first plank in the Unionist platform, and accepted a
general tariff on manufactured goods and a small duty on foreign
corn as &ldquo;not in principle objectionable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It may be left to future historians to attempt a considered
judgment on the English tariff reform movement, and on Mr
Chamberlain&rsquo;s responsibility for the Unionist <i>débâcle</i> of 1906.
But while his enemies taunted him with having twice wrecked his
party&mdash;first the Radical party under Mr Gladstone, and secondly
the Unionist party under Mr Balfour&mdash;no well-informed critic
doubted his sincerity, or failed to recognize that in leaving the
cabinet and embarking on his fiscal campaign he showed real
devotion to an idea. In championing the cause of imperial
fiscal union, by means involving the abandonment of a system
of taxation which had become part of British orthodoxy, he
followed the guidance of a profound conviction that the stability
of the empire and the very existence of the hegemony of the
United Kingdom depended upon the conversion of public
opinion to a revision of the current economic doctrine. There
were doubtless miscalculations at the outset as to the resistance
to be encountered. But from the purely party point of view
he was entitled to say that he followed the path of loyalty to
Mr Balfour which he had marked out from the moment of his
resignation, and that he persistently, refused to be put in competition
with him as leader. Even in the absence of the new issue,
defeat was foredoomed for Mr Balfour&rsquo;s administration by the
ordinary course of political events; and it might fairly be claimed
that &ldquo;Chinese slavery,&rdquo; &ldquo;passive resistance,&rdquo; and labour
irritation at the Taff Vale judgment (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Trade Unions</a></span>) were
mainly responsible for the Unionist collapse. Time alone would
show whether the system of free imports could be permanently
reconciled with British imperial policy or commercial prosperity.
It remained the fact that Mr Chamberlain staked an already
established position on his refusal to compromise with his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page819" id="page819"></a>819</span>
convictions on a question which appeared to him of vital and
immediate importance.</p>

<p>Mr Chamberlain&rsquo;s own activity in the political field was cut
short in the middle of the session of 1906 by a serious attack of
gout, which was at first minimized by his friends, but which,
it was gradually discovered, had completely crippled him.
Though encouragement was given to the idea that he might
return to the House of Commons, where he continued to retain
his seat for Birmingham, he was quite incapacitated for any
public work; and this invalid condition was protracted throughout
1907, 1908 and 1909. But he remained in the background as
the inspirer and adviser of the Tariff Reformers. The cause
made continuous headway at by-elections, and though the general
election of January 1910 gave the Unionists no majority it saw
them returned in much increased strength, which was chiefly
due to the support obtained for tariff reform principles. Mr
Chamberlain himself was returned unopposed for West Birmingham
again.</p>

soldier and educationalist, was born at Brewer, Maine,
on the 8th of September 1828. He graduated at Bowdoin College
in 1852, and at the Bangor Theological Seminary in 1855, and
was successively tutor in logic and natural theology (1855-1856),
professor of rhetoric and oratory (1856-1861), and professor
of modern languages (1861-1865), at Bowdoin. In 1862 he
entered the Federal army as lieutenant-colonel of the 20th
Maine Infantry. His military career was marked by great
personal bravery and energy and intrepidity as a leader. He
was six times wounded, and participated in all the important
battles in the East from Antietam onwards, including Fredericksburg,
Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, the Wilderness, Cold Harbor,
Petersburg and Five Forks. For his conduct at Petersburg,
where he was severely wounded, he was promoted to be brigadier-general
of volunteers. He was breveted major-general of
volunteers on the 29th of March 1865, and led the Federal
advance in the final operations against General R.E. Lee.
In 1893 he received a Congressional medal of honour &ldquo;for daring
heroism and great tenacity in holding his position on the Little
Round Top and carrying the advance position on the Great
Round Top at the Battle of Gettysburg.&rdquo; After the war he was
again professor of rhetoric and oratory at Bowdoin in 1865-1866,
and in 1867-1870 was governor of Maine, having been elected
as a Republican. From 1871 to 1883 he was president of Bowdoin
College, and during 1874-1879 was professor of mental and moral
philosophy also. Appointed in 1880 by Alonzo Garcelon, the
retiring governor, to protect the property and institutions of the
state until a new governor should be duly qualified, and acting
as major-general of the state militia, Chamberlain did much to
avert possible civil war, at a time of great political excitement
and bitter partisan feeling. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Maine</a></span>: <i>History</i>.) In 1883-1885
he was a lecturer on political science and public law at
Bowdoin, and in 1900 became surveyor of customs for the district
of Portland, Maine. He published <i>Maine, Her Place in History</i>
(1877), and edited <i>Universities and Their Sons</i> (6 vols., 1898).</p>

first baronet, consul-general and chargé d&rsquo;affaires in Brazil, and
was born at Rio on the 10th of January 1820. He entered the
Indian army in 1837, served as a subaltern in the first Afghan
War (1839-42), and was wounded on six occasions. He was
attached to the Governor-General&rsquo;s Bodyguard at the battle
of Maharajpur, in the Gwalior campaign of 1843, was appointed
military secretary to the governor of Bombay in 1846, and
honorary aide-de-camp to the governor-general of India in 1847.
He served on the staff throughout the Punjab campaign of 1848-49,
and was given a brevet majority. In 1850 he was appointed
commandant of the Punjab military police, and in 1852 military
secretary to the Punjab government. Promoted lieut.-colonel in
1854, he was given the command of the Punjab Frontier Force
with rank of brigadier-general, and commanded in several
expeditions against the frontier tribes. In the Indian Mutiny
he succeeded Colonel Chester as adjutant-general of the Indian
army, and distinguished himself at the siege of Delhi, where he
was severely wounded. He was rewarded with a brevet-colonelcy,
the appointment of A.D.C. to the queen, and the C.B.
He was reappointed to the command of the Punjab Frontier
Force in 1858, and commanded in the Umbeyla campaign (1863),
in which he was severely wounded. He was now made major-general
for distinguished service and a K.C.B. He was made
K.C.S.I. in 1866, lieut.-general in 1872, G.C.S.I. in 1873, G.C.B
in 1875, and general in 1877. From 1876 to 1881 he was commander-in-chief
of the Madras army, and in 1878 was sent on
a mission to the amir of Afghanistan, whose refusal to allow
him to enter the country precipitated the second Afghan War.
He was for some time acting military member of the council of

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHAMBERLAIN<a name="ar109" id="ar109"></a></span> (O. Fr. <i>chamberlain, chamberlenc</i>, Mod. Fr.
<i>chambellan</i>, from O.H. Ger. <i>Chamarling, Chamarlinc</i>, whence
also the Med. Lat. <i>cambellanus, camerlingus, camerlengus</i>; Ital.
<i>camerlingo</i>; Span, <i>camerlengo</i>, compounded of O.H. Ger.
<i>Chamara, Kamara</i> [Lat. <i>camera</i>, &ldquo;chamber&rdquo;], and the Ger.
suffix <i>-ling</i>), etymologically, and also to a large extent historically,
an officer charged with the superintendence of domestic affairs.
Such were the chamberlains of monasteries or cathedrals, who
had charge of the finances, gave notice of chapter meetings, and
provided the materials necessary for the various services. In
these cases, as in that of the apostolic chamberlain of the Roman
see, the title was borrowed from the usage of the courts of the
western secular princes. A royal chamberlain is now a court
official whose function is in general to attend on the person of
the sovereign and to regulate the etiquette of the palace. He is
the representative of the medieval <i>camberlanus, cambellanus</i>,
or <i>cubicularius</i>, whose office was modelled on that of the <i>praefectus
sacri cubiculi</i> or <i>cubicularius</i> of the Roman emperors. But
at the outset there was another class of chamberlains, the
<i>camerarii</i>, <i>i.e.</i> high officials charged with the administration of
the royal treasury (<i>camera</i>). The <i>camerarius</i> of the Carolingian
emperors was the equivalent of the <i>hordere</i> or <i>thesaurarius</i>
(treasurer) of the Anglo-Saxon kings; he develops into the
<i>Erzkämmerer</i> (<i>archicamerarius</i>) of the Holy Roman Empire,
an office held by the margraves of Brandenburg, and the <i>grand
chambrier</i> of France, who held his <i>chamberie</i> as a fief. Similarly
in England after the Norman conquest the <i>hordere</i> becomes the
chamberlain. This office was of great importance. Before the
Conquest he had been, with the marshal, the principal officer of
the king&rsquo;s court; and under the Norman sovereigns his functions
were manifold. As he had charge of the administration of the
royal household, his office was of financial importance, for a
portion of the royal revenue was paid, not into the exchequer, but
in <i>camera regis</i>. In course of time the office became hereditary
and titular, but the complexities of the duties necessitated a
division of the work, and the office was split up into three: the
hereditary and sinecure office of <i>magister camerarius</i> or lord
great chamberlain (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lord Great Chamberlain</a></span>), the more
important domestic office of <i>camerarius regis</i>, king&rsquo;s chamberlain
or lord chamberlain (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lord Chamberlain</a></span>), and the chamberlains
(<i>camerarii</i>) of the exchequer, two in number, who were
originally representatives of the chamberlain at the exchequer,
and afterwards in conjunction with the treasurer presided over
that department. In 1826 the last of these officials died, when
by an act passed forty-four years earlier they disappeared.</p>

<p>In France the office of <i>grand chambrier</i> was early overshadowed
by the <i>chamberlains (cubicularii, cambellani</i>, but sometimes
also <i>camerarii</i>), officials in close personal attendance on the king,
men at first of low rank, but of great and ever-increasing influence.
As the office of <i>grand chambrier</i>, held by great feudal
nobles seldom at court, became more and more honorary, the
chamberlains grew in power, in numbers and in rank, until,
in the 13th century, one of them emerges as a great officer
of state, the <i>chambellan de France</i> or <i>grand chambellan</i> (also
<i>magister cambellanorum, mestre chamberlenc</i>), who at times shares
with the <i>grand chambrier</i> the revenues derived from certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page820" id="page820"></a>820</span>
trades in the city of Paris (see <i>Regestum Memoralium Camerae
computorum</i>, quoted in du Cange, s. <i>Cameranus</i>). The honorary
office of <i>grand chambrier</i> survived till the time of Henry II.,
who was himself the last to hold it before his accession; that of
<i>grand chambellan</i>, which in its turn soon became purely honorary,
survived till the Revolution. Among the prerogatives of the
<i>grand chambellan</i> which survived to the last not the least
valued was the right to hand the king his shirt at the ceremonial
levée. The offices of <i>grand chambellan, premier chambellan</i>, and
<i>chambellan</i> were revived by Napoleon, continued under the
Restoration, abolished by Louis Philippe, and again restored
by Napoleon III.</p>

<p>In the papal Curia the apostolic chamberlain (Lat. <i>camerarius</i>,
Ital. <i>camerlingo</i>) occupies a very important position. He is at
the head of the treasury (<i>camera thesauraria</i>) and, in the days of
the temporal power, not only administered the papal finances
but possessed an extensive civil and criminal jurisdiction.
During a vacancy of the Holy See he is at the head of the administration
of the Roman Church. The office dates from the
11th century, when it superseded that of archdeacon of the
Roman Church, and the close personal relations of the <i>camerarius</i>
with the pope, together with the fact that he is the official
guardian of the ceremonial vestments and treasures, point to
the fact that he is also the representative of the former <i>vestararius</i>
and <i>vice-dominus</i>, whose functions were merged in the new
office, of which the idea and title were probably borrowed from
the usage of the secular courts of the West (Hinschius, <i>Kirchenrecht</i>,
i. 405, &amp;c.). There are also attached to the papal household
(<i>famiglia pontificia</i>) a large number of chamberlains whose
functions are more or less ornamental. These are divided into
several categories: privy chamberlains (<i>camerieri segreti</i>),
chamberlains, assistant and honorary chamberlains. These
are gentlemen of rank and belong to the highest class of the
household (<i>famiglia nobile</i>).</p>

<p>In England the modern representatives of the <i>cubicularii</i> are
the gentlemen and grooms of the bed-chamber, in Germany the
<i>Kammerherr</i> (<i>Kämmerer</i>, from <i>camerarius</i>, in Bavaria and Austria)
and <i>Kammerjunker</i>. The insignia of their office is a gold key
attached to their coats behind.</p>

<p>Many corporations appoint a chamberlain. The most
important in England is the chamberlain of the corporation
of the city of London, who is treasurer of the corporation,
admits persons entitled to the freedom of the city, and, in
the chamberlain&rsquo;s court, of which he and the vice-chamberlain
are judges, exercises concurrent jurisdiction with the police
court in determining disputes between masters and apprentices.
Formerly nominated by the crown, since 1688 he has been elected
annually by the liverymen. He has a salary of £2000 a year.
Similarly in Germany the administration of the finances of a
city is called the <i>Kämmerei</i> and the official in charge of it the
<i>Kämmerer</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAMBERLAYNE, WILLIAM<a name="ar110" id="ar110"></a></span> (1619-1679), English poet,
was born in 1619. Nothing is known of his history except that
he practised as a physician at Shaftesbury in Dorsetshire, and
fought on the Royalist side at the second battle of Newbury.
He died on the 11th of July 1679. His works are: <i>Pharonnida</i>
(1659), a verse romance in five books; <i>Love&rsquo;s Victory</i> (1658), a
tragi-comedy, acted under another title in 1678 at the Theatre
Royal; <i>England&rsquo;s Jubilee</i> (1660), a poem in honour of the
Restoration. A prose version of <i>Pharonnida</i>, entitled <i>Eromena</i>,
or the <i>Noble Stranger</i>, appeared in 1683. Southey speaks of him
as &ldquo;a poet to whom I am indebted for many hours of delight.&rdquo;
<i>Pharonnida</i> was reprinted by S.W. Singer in 1820, and again
in 1905 by Prof. G. Saintsbury in <i>Minor Poets of the Caroline

<p><span class="bold">CHAMBERS, EPHRAIM<a name="ar111" id="ar111"></a></span> (d. 1740), English encyclopaedist,
was born at Kendal, Westmorland, in the latter part of the 17th
century. He was apprenticed to a globe-maker in London, but
having conceived the plan of his Cyclopaedia, or <i>Universal
Dictionary of Arts and Sciences</i>, he devoted himself entirely to it.
The first edition appeared by subscription in 1728, in two vols.
fol., and dedicated to the king (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Encyclopaedia</a></span>). The
<i>Encyclopédie</i> of Diderot and d&rsquo;Alembert owed its inception to a
French translation of Chambers&rsquo;s work. In addition to the <i>Cyclopaedia</i>,
Chambers wrote for the <i>Literary Magazine</i> (1735-1736),
and translated the <i>History and Memoirs of the Royal Academy of
Sciences at Paris</i> (1742), and the <i>Practice of Perspective</i> from the
French of Jean Dubreuil. He died on the 15th of May 1740.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAMBERS, GEORGE<a name="ar112" id="ar112"></a></span> (1803-1840), English marine painter,
born at Whitby, Yorkshire, was the son of a seaman, and for
several years he pursued his father&rsquo;s calling. While at sea he
was in the habit of sketching the different classes of vessels. His
master, observing this, gratified him by cancelling his indentures,
and thus set him free to follow his natural bent. Chambers then
apprenticed himself to an old woman who kept a painter&rsquo;s shop
in Whitby, and began by house-painting. He also took lessons
of a drawing-master, and found a ready sale for small and cheap
pictures of shipping. Coming afterwards to London, he was
employed by Thomas Horner to assist in painting the great
panorama of London for the Colosseum (the exhibition building
in Regent&rsquo;s Park, demolished towards 1860), and he next became
scene-painter at the Pavilion theatre. In 1834 he was elected
an associate, and in 1836 a full member, of the Water-colour
Society. His best works represent naval battles. Two of these&mdash;the
&ldquo;Bombardment of Algiers in 1816,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Capture of
Porto Bello&rdquo;&mdash;are in Greenwich hospital. Not long before his
death he was introduced to William IV., and his professional
prospects brightened; but his constitution, always frail, gave
way, and he died on the 28th of October 1840.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAMBERS, ROBERT<a name="ar113" id="ar113"></a></span> (1802-1871), Scottish author and
publisher, was born at Peebles on the 10th of July 1802. He
was sent to the local schools, and gave evidence of unusual
literary taste and ability. A small circulating library in the
town, and a copy of the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i> which his
father had purchased, furnished him with stores of reading of
which he eagerly availed himself. Long afterwards he wrote
of his early years&mdash;&ldquo;Books, not playthings, filled my hands in
childhood. At twelve I was deep, not only in poetry and fiction,
but in encyclopaedias.&rdquo; Robert had been destined for the
church, but this design had to be abandoned for lack of means.
The family removed to Edinburgh in 1813, and in 1818 Robert
began business as a bookstall-keeper in Leith Walk. He was
then only sixteen, and his whole stock consisted of a few old
books belonging to his father. In 1819 his elder brother William
had begun a similar business, and the two eventually united as
partners in the publishing firm of W. &amp; R. Chambers. Robert
Chambers showed an enthusiastic interest in the history and
antiquities of Edinburgh, and found a most congenial task in
his <i>Traditions of Edinburgh</i> (2 vols., 1824), which secured for him
the approval and the personal friendship of Sir Walter Scott.
A <i>History of the Rebellions in Scotland from 1638 to 1745</i> (5
vols., 1828) and numerous other works followed.</p>

<p>In the beginning of 1832 William Chambers started a weekly
publication under the title of <i>Chambers&rsquo;s Edinburgh Journal</i>
(known since 1854 as <i>Chambers&rsquo;s Journal of Literature, Science
and Arts</i>), which speedily attained a large circulation. Robert
was at first only a contributor. After fourteen numbers had
appeared, however, he was associated with his brother as joint-editor,
and his collaboration contributed more perhaps than
anything else to the success of the <i>Journal</i>.</p>

<p>Among the other numerous works of which Robert was in
whole or in part the author, the <i>Biographical Dictionary of
Eminent Scotsmen</i> (4 vols., Glasgow, 1832-1835), the <i>Cyclopaedia
of English Literature</i> (1844), the <i>Life and Works of Robert Burns</i>
(4 vols., 1851), <i>Ancient Sea Margins</i> (1848), the <i>Domestic Annals
of Scotland</i> (3 vols., 1859-1861) and the <i>Book of Days</i> (2 vols.,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page821" id="page821"></a>821</span>
1862-1864) were the most important. <i>Chambers&rsquo;s Encyclopaedia</i>
(1859-1868), with Dr Andrew Findlater as editor, was carried
out under the superintendence of the brothers (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Encyclopaedia</a></span>).
The <i>Cyclopaedia of English Literature</i><a name="fa1d" id="fa1d" href="#ft1d"><span class="sp">1</span></a> contains a
series of admirably selected extracts from the best authors of
every period, &ldquo;set in a biographical and critical history of the
literature itself.&rdquo; For the <i>Life of Burns</i> he made diligent and
laborious original investigations, gathering many hitherto
unrecorded facts from the poet&rsquo;s sister, Mrs Begg, to whose
benefit the whole profits of the work were generously devoted.
Robert Chambers was a scientific geologist, and availed himself
of tours in Scandinavia and Canada for the purpose of geological
exploration. The results of his travels were embodied in
<i>Tracings of the North of Europe</i> (1851) and <i>Tracings in Iceland
and the Faroe Islands</i> (1856). His knowledge of geology was
one of the principal grounds on which the authorship of the
<i>Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation</i> (2 vols., 1843-1846)
was eventually assigned to him. The book was published
anonymously. Robert Chambers was aware of the storm that
would probably be raised at the time by a rational treatment
of the subject, and did not wish to involve his firm in the discredit
that a charge of heterodoxy would bring with it. The arrangements
for publication were made through Alexander Ireland
of Manchester, and the secret was so well kept that such different
names as those of Prince Albert and Sir Charles Lyell were
coupled with the book. Ireland in 1884 issued a 12th edition,
with a preface giving an account of its authorship, which there
was no longer any reason for concealing. The <i>Book of Days</i> was
Chambers&rsquo;s last publication, and perhaps his most elaborate.
It was a miscellany of popular antiquities in connexion with the
calendar, and it is supposed that his excessive labour in connexion
with this book hastened his death, which took place at St Andrews
on the 17th of March 1871. Two years before, the university
of St Andrews had conferred upon him the degree of doctor of
laws, and he was elected a member of the Athenaeum club in
London. It is his highest claim to distinction that he did so
much to give a healthy tone to the cheap popular literature
which has become so important a factor in modern civilization.</p>

<p>His brother, <span class="sc">William Chambers</span> (1800-1883) was born at
Peebles, on the 16th of April 1800. He was the financial genius
of the publishing firm. He laid the city of Edinburgh under the
greatest obligations by his public spirit and munificence. As
lord provost he procured the passing in 1867 of the Improvement
Act, which led to the reconstruction of a great part of the Old
Town, and at a later date he proposed and carried out, largely
at his own expense, the restoration of the noble and then
neglected church of St Giles, making it in a sense &ldquo;the Westminster
Abbey of Scotland.&rdquo; This service was fitly acknowledged
by the offer of a baronetcy, which he did not live to receive,
dying on the 20th of May 1883, three days before the reopening
of the church. He was the author of a history of St Giles&rsquo;s, of
a memoir of himself and his brother (1872), and of many other
useful publications. On his death in 1883 Robert Chambers
(1832-1888), son of Robert Chambers, succeeded as head of the
firm, and edited the <i>Journal</i> until his death. His eldest son,
Charles Edward Stuart Chambers (b. 1859), became editor of
the <i>Journal</i> and chairman of W. &amp; R. Chambers, Limited.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAMBERS, SIR WILLIAM<a name="ar114" id="ar114"></a></span> (1726-1796), British architect,
was the grandson of a rich merchant who had financed the
armies of Charles XII., but was paid in base money, and whose
son remained in Sweden many years endeavouring to obtain
redress. In 1728 the latter returned to England and settled at
Ripon, where William, who was born in Stockholm, was educated.
At the age of sixteen he became supercargo to the Swedish East
India Company, and voyaging to Canton made drawings of Chinese
architecture, furniture and costume which served as basis for
his <i>Designs for Chinese Buildings</i>, &amp;c. (1757). Two years later
he quitted the sea to study architecture seriously, and spent a
long time in Italy, devoting special attention to the buildings
of classical and Renaissance architects. He also studied under
Clérisseau in Paris, with whom and with the sculptor Wilton he
lived at Rome. In 1755 he returned to England with Cipriani
and Wilton, and married the beautiful daughter of the latter.
His first important commission was a villa for Lord Bessborough
at Roehampton, but he made his reputation by the grounds
he laid out and the buildings he erected at Kew between
1757 and 1762 for Augusta, princess dowager of Wales. Some
of them have since been demolished, but the most important,
the pagoda, still survives. The publication in a handsome
volume of the designs for these buildings assured his position in
the profession. He was employed to teach architectural drawing
to the prince of Wales (George III.), and gained further professional
distinction in 1759 by the publication of his <i>Treatise
of Civil Architecture</i>. He began to exhibit with the Society of
Artists in 1761 at Spring Gardens, and was one of the original
members and treasurer of the Royal Academy when it was
established in 1768. In 1772 he published his <i>Dissertation on
Oriental Gardening</i>, which attempted to prove the inferiority
of European to Chinese landscape gardening. As a furniture
designer and internal decorator he is credited with the creation
of that &ldquo;Chinese Style&rdquo; which was for a time furiously popular,
although Thomas Chippendale (<i>q.v.</i>) had published designs in
that manner at a somewhat earlier date. It is not unreasonable
to count the honours as divided, since Chippendale unquestionably
adapted and altered the Chinese shapes in a manner
better to fit them for European use. To the rage for every
possible form of <i>chinoiserie</i>, for which he is chiefly responsible,
Sir William Chambers owed much of his success in life. He
became architect to the king and queen, comptroller of his
majesty&rsquo;s works, and afterwards surveyor-general. In 1775 he
was appointed architect of Somerset House, his greatest monument,
at a salary of £2000 a year. He also designed town
mansions for Earl Gower at Whitehall and Lord Melbourne in
Piccadilly, built Charlemont House, Dublin, and Duddingston
House near Edinburgh. He designed the market house at
Worcester, was employed by the earl of Pembroke at Wilton, by
the duke of Marlborough at Blenheim, and by the duke of Bedford
in Bloomsbury. The state coach of George III., his constant
patron, was his work; it is now in the Victoria and Albert
Museum. Although his practice was mainly Classic, he made
Gothic additions to Milton Abbey in Dorset. Sir William Chambers
achieved considerable distinction as a designer of furniture. In
addition to his work in the Chinese style and in the contemporary
fashions, he was the author of what is probably the most
ambitious and monumental piece of furniture ever produced in
England. This was a combined bureau, dressing-case, jewel-cabinet
and organ, made for Charles IV., king of Spain, in 1793.
These combination pieces were in the taste of the time, and the
effort displays astonishing ingenuity and resource. The panels
were painted by W. Hamilton, R.A., with representations of the
four seasons, night and morning, fire and water, Juno and Ceres,
together with representations of the Golden Fleece and the
Immaculate Conception. The organ, in the domed top, is in a
case decorated with ormolu and Wedgwood. This remarkable
achievement, which possesses much sober elegance, formed part
of the loan collection of English furniture at the Franco-British
Exhibition in London in 1908. Sir William Chambers
numbered among his friends Dr Johnson, Goldsmith, Sir Joshua
Reynolds, David Garrick and Dr Burney.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAMBERS<a name="ar115" id="ar115"></a></span> (the Fr. <i>chambre</i>, from Lat. <i>camera</i>, a room), a
term used generally of rooms or apartments, but especially in
law of the offices of a lawyer or the semi-private rooms in which
judges or judicial officers deal with questions of practice and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page822" id="page822"></a>822</span>
other matters not of sufficient importance to be dealt with in
court. It is a matter of doubt at what period the practice of
exercising jurisdiction &ldquo;in chambers&rdquo; commenced in England;
there is no statutory sanction before 1821, though the custom
can be traced back to the 17th century. An act of 1821 provided
for sittings in chambers between terms, and an act of 1822
empowered the sovereign to call upon the judges by warrant to
sit in chambers on as many days in vacation as should seem fit,
while the Law Terms Act 1830 defined the jurisdiction to be
exercised at chambers. The Judges&rsquo; Chambers Act 1867 was
the first act, however, to lay down proper regulations for chamber
work, and the Judicature Act 1873 preserved that jurisdiction
and gave power to increase it as might be directed or authorized
by rules of court to be thereafter made. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Chancery</a></span>;

<p><span class="bold">CHAMBERSBURG,<a name="ar116" id="ar116"></a></span> a borough and the county-seat of Franklin
county, Pennsylvania, U.S.A., at the confluence of Conoco-cheague
Creek and Falling Spring, 52 m. S.W. of Harrisburg.
Pop. (1890) 7863; (1900) 8864, of whom 769 were negroes;
(1910) 11,800. It is served by the Cumberland Valley and
the Western Maryland railways, and is connected by electric
lines with Greencastle, Waynesboro, Caledonia, a beautiful park
in the Pennsylvania timber reservation, on South Mountain,
12 m. east of Chambersburg, and Pen Mar, a summer resort,
on South Mountain, near the boundary line between Pennsylvania
and Maryland. Chambersburg is built on an elevated
site in the broad and fertile Cumberland Valley, and commands
a fine view of the distant hills and dales. The borough is the
seat of Chambersburg Academy, a preparatory school; Penn
Hall, a school for girls; and Wilson College, a Presbyterian
institution for women, opened in 1870. The Wilson College
campus, the former estate of Col. A.K. McClure (1828-1909),
a well-known journalist, was laid out by Donald G. Mitchell
(&ldquo;Ik Marvel&rdquo;), who was an enthusiastic landscape gardener.
The shops of the Cumberland Valley railway are at Chambersburg,
and among the borough&rsquo;s manufactures are milling machinery,
boilers, engines, hydraulic presses, steam-hammers, engineering
and bridge supplies, hosiery, shoes, gloves, furniture, flour,
paper, leather, carriages and agricultural implements; the
total value of its factory product in 1905 was $1,085,185. The
waterworks and the electric-lighting plant are owned and
operated by the municipality. A settlement was founded here
in 1730 by Benjamin Chambers, in whose honour the borough
was named, and who, immediately after General Edward
Braddock&rsquo;s defeat in 1755, built a stone fort and surrounded it
with a stockade for the protection of the community from the
Indians. Chambersburg was laid out in 1764 and was incorporated
as a borough in 1803. On the 30th of July 1864 Chambersburg
was occupied by a Confederate cavalry force under
General McCausland (acting under General Jubal A. Early&rsquo;s
orders), who, upon the refusal of the citizens to pay $100,000
for immunity, burned a large part of the borough.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHAMBÉRY,<a name="ar117" id="ar117"></a></span> a city of France, capital of the department of
Savoie, pleasantly situated in a fertile district, between two
hills, on the rivers Leysse and Albane, 79 m. by rail S.S.W.
of Geneva. Pop. (1906) town, 16,852; commune, 23,027. The
town is irregularly built, and has only two good streets&mdash;the
Place Saint-Léger and the Rue de Boigne, the latter being named
after General Benoît Boigne (1741-1830), who left a fortune
of 3,400,000 francs (accumulated in India) to the town. The
principal buildings are the cathedral, dating from the 14th and
15th centuries; the Hôtel-Dieu, founded in 1647; the castle,
a modern building serving as the prefecture, and preserving
only a great square tower belonging to the original structure;
the palace of justice, the theatre, the barracks, and the covered
market, which dates from 1863. Several of the squares are
adorned with fountains; the old ramparts of the city, destroyed
during the French Revolution, have been converted into public
walks; and various promenades and gardens have been constructed.
Chambéry is the seat of an archbishop (raised to that
dignity from a bishopric in 1817) and of a superior tribunal.
It has also a Jesuit college, a royal academical society, a society
of agriculture and commerce, a public library with 60,000 volumes,
a museum (antiquities and paintings), a botanic garden, and
many charitable institutions. It manufactures silk-gauze, lace,
leather and hats, and has a considerable trade in liqueurs, wine,
lead, copper and other articles. Overlooking the town on the
north is the Rocher de Lémenc, which derives its name from the
<i>Lemincum</i> of the Romans; and in the vicinity is Les Charmettes,
for some time (1736-1740) the residence of Rousseau.</p>

<p>The origin of Chambéry is unknown, but its lords are mentioned
for the first time in 1029. In 1232 it was sold to the count of
Savoy, Thomas I., who bestowed several important privileges on
the inhabitants. As capital of the duchy of Savoy, it has passed
through numerous political vicissitudes. Between 1536 and 1713
it was several times occupied by the French; in 1742 it was
captured by a Franco-Spanish army; and in 1792 it was occupied
by the Republican forces, and became the capital of the department
of Mont Blanc. Restored to the house of Savoy by the
treaties of Vienna and Paris, it was again surrendered to France
in 1860. Among the famous men whom it has given to France,
the most important are Vaugelas (1585-1650), Saint-Réal (1639-1692),
and the brothers Joseph (1754-1821) and Xavier (1763-1852)
de Maistre.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAMBORD, HENRI CHARLES FERDINAND MARIE
DIEUDONNÉ<a name="ar117a" id="ar117a"></a></span> <span class="sc">Comte de</span> (1820-1883), the &ldquo;King Henry V.&rdquo; of the
French legitimists, was born in Paris on the 29th of September
1820. His father was the duc de Berry, the elder son of the comte
d&rsquo;Artois (afterwards Charles X.); his mother was the princess
Caroline Ferdinande Louise of Naples. Born seven months after
the assassination of his father, he was hailed as the &ldquo;enfant du
miracle,&rdquo; and was made the subject of one of Lamartine&rsquo;s most
famous poems. He was created duc de Bordeaux, and in 1821,
as the result of a subscription organized by the government,
received the château of Chambord. He was educated by tutors
inspired by detestation of the French Revolution and its principles,
and from the duc de Damas in particular imbibed those
ideas of divine right and of devotion to the Church to which
he always remained true. After the revolution of July, Charles
X. vainly endeavoured to save the Bourbon cause by abdicating
in his favour and proclaiming him king under the title of Henry V.
(August 2, 1830). The comte de Chambord accompanied his
grandfather into exile, and resided successively at Holyrood,
Prague, and Görz. In 1841, during an extensive tour through
Europe, he broke his leg&mdash;an accident that resulted in permanent
lameness. The death of his grandfather, Charles X., in 1836,
and of his uncle, the duc d&rsquo;Angoulême, in 1844, left him the last
male representative of the elder branch of the Bourbon family;
and his marriage with the archduchess Maria Theresa, eldest
daughter of the duke of Modena (November 7, 1846), remained
without issue. The title to the throne thus passed to the comte
de Paris, as representative of the Orleans branch of the house of
Bourbon, and the history of the comte de Chambord&rsquo;s life is
largely an account of the efforts made to unite the Royalist party
by effecting a reconciliation between the two princes. Though he
continued to hold an informal court, both on his travels and at
his castle of Frohsdorf, near Vienna, yet he allowed the revolution
of 1848 and the <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i> of 1851 to pass without any decisive
assertion of his claims. It was the Italian war of 1859, with its
menace to the pope&rsquo;s independence, that roused him at last to
activity. He declared himself ready &ldquo;to pay with his blood for
the triumph of a cause which was that of France, the Church,
and God himself.&rdquo; Making common cause with the Church, the
Royalists now began an active campaign against the Empire.
On the 9th of December 1866 he addressed a manifesto to General
Saint-Priest, in which he declared the cause of the pope to be that
of society and liberty, and held out promises of retrenchment,
civil and religious liberty, &ldquo;and above all honesty.&rdquo; Again, on
the 4th of September 1870, after the fall of the Empire, he invited
Frenchmen to accept a government &ldquo;whose basis was right and
whose principle was honesty,&rdquo; and promised to drive the enemy
from French soil. These vague phrases, offered as a panacea to a
nation fighting for its life, showed conclusively his want of all
political genius; they had as little effect on the French as his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page823" id="page823"></a>823</span>
protest against the bombardment of Paris had on the Germans.
Yet fortune favoured him. The elections placed the Republican
party in a minority in the National Assembly; the abrogation of
the law of exile against the royal family permitted him to return
to his castle of Chambord; and it was thence that on the 5th of
July 1871 he issued a proclamation, in which for the first time he
publicly posed as king, and declared that he would never abandon
the white standard of the Bourbons, &ldquo;the flag of Henry IV.,
Francis I., and Joan of Arc,&rdquo; for the tricolour of the Revolution.
He again quitted France, and answered the attempts to make
him renounce his claims in favour of the comte de Paris by the
declaration (January 25, 1872) that he would never abdicate.
In the following month he held a great gathering of his adherents
at Antwerp, which was the cause of serious disturbances. A
constitutional programme, signed by some 280 members of the
National Assembly, was presented for his acceptance, but without
result. The fall of Thiers in May 1873, however, offered an opportunity
to the Royalists by which they hastened to profit. The
comte de Paris and the prince de Joinville journeyed to Frohsdorf,
and were formally reconciled with the head of the family (August
5). The Royalists were united, the premier (the duc de Broglie)
an open adherent, the president (MacMahon) a benevolent neutral.
MM. Lucien Brun and Chesnelong were sent to interview the
comte de Chambord at Salzburg, and obtain the definite assurances
that alone were wanting. They returned with the news
that he accepted the principles of the French Revolution and the
tricolour flag. But a letter to Chesnelong, dated Salzburg, 27th
of October, declared that he had been misunderstood: he would
give no guarantees; he would not inaugurate his reign by an act
of weakness, nor become &ldquo;le roi légitime de la Révolution.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Je suis le pilote nécessaire,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;le seul capable de
conduire le navire au port, parce que j&rsquo;ai mission et autorité pour
cela.&rdquo; This outspoken adherence to the principle of divine right
did credit to his honesty, but it cost him the crown. The duc de
Broglie carried the septennate, and the Republic steadily established
itself in popular favour. A last effort was made in the
National Assembly in June 1874 by the duc de la Rochefoucauld-Bisaccia,
who formally moved the restoration of the monarchy.
The comte de Chambord on the 2nd of July issued a fresh manifesto,
which added nothing to his former declarations. The
motion was rejected by 272 to 79, and on the 25th of February
1875 the Assembly definitely adopted the Republic as the national
form of government. From this time the comte de Chambord,
though continuing to publish letters on political affairs, made no
further effort to regain the throne. He died at Frohsdorf on the
24th of August 1883.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAMBORD,<a name="ar118" id="ar118"></a></span> a village of central France, in the department
of Loir-et-Cher, on the left bank of the Cosson, 10 m. E. by N.
of Blois by road. The village stands in the park of Chambord,
which is enclosed by a wall 21 m. in circumference. The celebrated
château (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Architecture</a></span>: <i>Renaissance Architecture
in France</i>) forms a parallelogram flanked at the angles by
round towers and enclosing a square block of buildings, the
façade of which forms the centre of the main front. The profusion
of turrets, pinnacles, and dormer windows which decorates the
roof of this, the chief portion of the château, constitutes the main
feature of the exterior, while in the interior are a well-preserved
chapel of the 16th century and a famous double staircase, the
construction of which permits two people to ascend and descend
respectively without seeing one another. There are 440 apartments,
containing pictures of the 17th century and souvenirs
of the comte de Chambord. The château was originally a hunting-box
of the counts of Blois, the rebuilding of which was begun
by Francis I. in 1526, and completed under Henry II. It was
the residence of several succeeding monarchs, and under Louis
XIV. considerable alterations were made. In the same reign
Molière performed <i>Monsieur de Pourceaugnac</i> and <i>Le Bourgeois
gentilhomme</i> for the first time in the theatre. Stanislaus, king
of Poland, lived at Chambord, which was bestowed by his son-in-law,
Louis XV., upon Marshal Saxe. It was given by Napoleon
to Marshal Berthier, from whose widow it was purchased by
subscription in 1821, and presented to the duc de Bordeaux,
the representative of the older branch of the Bourbons, who
assumed from it the title of comte de Chambord. On his death
in 1883 it came by bequest into the possession of the family of
Parma.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAMBRE ARDENTE<a name="ar119" id="ar119"></a></span> (Fr. &ldquo;burning chamber&rdquo;), the term
for an extraordinary court of justice in France, mainly held for
the trials of heretics. The name is perhaps an allusion to the
fact that the proceedings took place in a room from which all
daylight was excluded, the only illumination being from torches,
or there may be a reference to the severity of the sentences in
<i>ardente</i>, suggesting the burning of the prisoners at the stake.
These courts were originated by the Cardinal of Lorraine, the
first of them meeting in 1535 under Francis I. The <i>Chambre
Ardente</i> co-operated with an inquisitorial tribunal also established
by Francis I., the duty of which was to discover cases of heresy
and hand them over for final judgment to the <i>Chambre Ardente</i>.
The reign of Henry II. of France was particularly infamous for
the cruelties perpetrated by this court on the Huguenots. The
marquise de Brinvilliers (<i>q.v.</i>) and her associates were tried
in the <i>Chambre Ardente</i> in 1680. The court was abolished in
1682.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAMELEON,<a name="ar120" id="ar120"></a></span> the common name of one of the three suborders
of Lacertilia or lizards. The chief genus is <i>Chamaeleon</i>, containing
most of the fifty to sixty species of the whole group, and with
the most extensive range,
all through Africa and
Madagascar into Arabia,
southern India and Ceylon.
The Indian species is <i>Ch.
calcaratus</i>; the dwarf
chameleon of South Africa
is <i>Ch. pumilus</i>; the giant of
the whole tribe, reaching a
total length of 2 ft., is
<i>Ch. parsoni</i> of Madagascar.
The commonest species in
the trade is <i>Ch. vulgaris</i> of North Africa, introduced into
southern Andalusia. A few queer genera, with much stunted
tail, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Rhampholeon</i>, in tropical Africa and <i>Brookesia</i> in
Madagascar are the most aberrant. The common chameleon is
the most typical. The head is raised into a pyramidal crest far
beyond the occiput, there is no outer ear, nor a drum-cavity.
The limbs are very long and slender, and the digits form stout
grasping bundles; on the hand the first three form an inner
bundle, opposed to the remaining two; on the foot the inner
bundle is formed by the first and second toe, the outer by the
other three toes. The tail is prehensile, by being rolled downwards;
it is not brittle and cannot be renewed. The eyeballs are
large, but the lids are united into one concentric fold, leaving only
the small pupil visible. The right and left eyes are incessantly
moved separately from each other and literally in every direction,
up and down, forwards and straight backwards, producing the
most terrible squinting. Chameleons alone of all reptiles can
focus their eyes upon one spot, and conformably they alone
possess a retinal <i>macula centralis</i>, or spot of acutest, binocular
vision. The tongue has attained an extraordinary development.
It is club-shaped, covered with a sticky secretion, and based
upon a very narrow root, which is composed of extremely elastic
fibres and telescoped over the much elongated, style-shaped,
copular piece of the hyoid. The whole apparatus is kept in
a contracted state like a spring in a tube. When the spring
is released, so to speak, by filling the apparatus with blood and
by the play of the hyoid muscles, the heavy thick end shoots out
upon the insect prey and is withdrawn by its own elasticity.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page824" id="page824"></a>824</span>
The whole act is like a flash. An ordinary chameleon can shoot
a fly at the distance of fully 6 in., and it can manage even a big
sphinx moth.</p>

<p>Another remarkable feature is their changing of colour. This
proverbial power is greatly exaggerated. They cannot assume
in succession all the colours of the rainbow, nor are the changes
quick. The common chameleon may be said to be greenish grey,
changing to grass-green or to dull black, with or without maroon
red, or brown, lateral series of patches. At night the same
specimen assumes as a rule a more or less uniform pale straw-colour.
After it has been watched for several months, when all
its possibilities seem exhausted, it will probably surprise us by
a totally new combination, for instance, a black garb with many
small yellow specks, or green with many black specks. Pure
red and blue are not in the register of this species, but they are
rather the rule upon the dark green ground colour of the South
African dwarf chameleon. The changes are partly under control
of the will, partly complicated reflex actions, intentionally
adaptive to the physical and psychical surroundings. The
mechanism is as follows. The cutis contains several kinds of
specialized cells in many layers, each filled with minute granules
of guanine. The upper cells are the smallest, most densely
filled with crystals, and cause the white colour by diffusion
of direct light; near the Malpighian layer the cells are charged
with yellow oil drops; the deeper cells are the largest, tinged
light brown, and acting as a turbid medium they cause a blue
colour, which, owing to the superimposed yellow drops, reaches
our eye as green; provided always that there is an effective
screen at the back, and this is formed by large chromatophores
which lie at the bottom and send their black pigment half-way
up, or on to the top of the layers of guanine and oil containing
cells. When all the pigment is shifted towards the surface, as
near the epidermis as possible, the creature looks black; when
the black pigment is withdrawn into the basal portions of the
chromatophores the skin appears yellow.</p>

<p>The lungs are very capacious, and end in several narrow
blind sacs which extend far down into the body cavity, so that
not only the chest but the whole body can be blown up. This
happens when the animals hiss and fight, as they often do. But
when they know themselves discovered, they make themselves
as thin as possible by compressing the chest and belly vertically
by means of their peculiarly elongated ribs. The whole body
is then put into such a position that it presents only its narrow
edge to the enemy, and with the branch of the tree or shrub
interposed. They are absolutely arboreal, but they hibernate
in the ground.</p>

<p>The usual mode of propagation is by eggs, which are oval,
numerous, provided with a calcareous shell, and buried in humus,
whence they are hatched about four months later. But a few
species, <i>e.g.</i> the dwarf chameleon, are viviparous.</p>

<p>Chameleons are insectivorous. They prefer locusts, grass-hoppers
and lepidoptera, but are also fond of flies and mealworms.
They are notoriously difficult to keep in good health. They
want not only warmth, but sunshine, and they must have water,
which they lick up in drops from the edges of wet leaves whenever
they have a chance. The silliness of the fable that they live on
air is shown by the fact that they usually die in an absolutely
emaciated and parched condition after three or four months&rsquo;
starvation.</p>

in Auvergne in 1741. He was, according to a baptismal certificate
found among his papers, the son of a grocer named Nicolas. A
journey to Paris resulted in the boy&rsquo;s obtaining a bursary at the
Collège des Grassins. He worked hard, although he wrote later
in one of his most contemptuous epigrams&mdash;<i>&rdquo;Ce que j&rsquo;ai appris
je ne le sais plus; le peu que je sais je l&rsquo;ai diviné.&rdquo;</i> His college
career ended, Chamfort assumed the dress of a <i>petit abbé. &ldquo;C&rsquo;est
un costume, et non point un état,&rdquo;</i> he said; and to the principal
of his college who promised him a benefice, he replied that he
would never be a priest, inasmuch as he preferred honour to
honours&mdash;<i>&rdquo;j&rsquo;aime l&rsquo;honneur et non les honneurs.&rdquo;</i> About this
time he assumed the name of Chamfort.</p>

<p>For some time he contrived to exist by teaching and as a
booksellers&rsquo; hack. His good looks and ready wit, however, soon
brought him into notice; but though endowed with immense
strength&mdash;&ldquo;Hercule sous la figure d&rsquo;Adonis,&rdquo; Madame de Craon
called him&mdash;he lived so hard that he was glad of the chance of
doing a &ldquo;cure&rdquo; at Spa when the Belgian minister in Paris,
M. van Eyck, took him with him to Germany in 1761. On his
return to Paris he produced a comedy, <i>La Jeune Indienne</i> (1764),
which was performed with some success, and this was followed
by a series of &ldquo;epistles&rdquo; in verse, essays and odes. It was not,
however, until 1769, when he won the prize of the French
Academy for his <i>Éloge</i> on Molière, that his literary reputation
was established.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he had lived from hand to mouth, mainly on the
hospitality of people who were only too glad to give him board
and lodging in exchange for the pleasure of the conversation
for which he was famous. Thus Madame Helvétius entertained
him at Sèvres for some years. In 1770 another comedy, <i>Le
Marchand de Smyrne</i>, brought him still further into notice, and
he seemed on the road to fortune, when he was suddenly smitten
with a horrible disease. His distress was relieved by the generosity
of a friend, who made over to him a pension of 1200 livres charged
on the <i>Mercure de France</i>. With this assistance he was able to
go to the baths of Contrexéville and to spend some time in the
country, where he wrote an <i>Éloge</i> on La Fontaine which won the
prize of the Academy of Marseilles (1774). In 1775, while taking
the waters at Barèges, he met the duchesse de Grammont, sister
of Choiseul, through whose influence he was introduced at court.
In 1776 his poor tragedy, <i>Mustapha et Zeangir</i>, was played at
Fontainebleau before Louis XVI. and Marie Antoinette; the
king gave him a further pension of 1200 livres, and the prince de
Condé made him his secretary. But he was a Bohemian naturally
and by habit, the restraints of the court irked him, and with
increasing years he was growing misanthropical. After a year
he resigned his post in the prince&rsquo;s household and retired into
solitude at Auteuil. There, comparing the authors of old with
the men of his own time, he uttered the famous <i>mot</i> that proclaims
the superiority of the dead over the living as companions; and
there too he presently fell in love. The lady, attached to the
household of the duchesse du Maine, was forty-eight years old,
but clever, amusing, a woman of the world; and Chamfort
married her. They left Auteuil, and went to Vaucouleurs,
where in six months Madame Chamfort died. Chamfort lived in
Holland for a time with M. de Narbonne, and returning to Paris
received in 1781 the place at the Academy left vacant by the
death of La Curne de Sainte-Palaye, the author of the <i>Dictionnaire
des antiquités françaises</i>. In 1784, through the influence
of Calonne, he became secretary to the king&rsquo;s sister, Madame
Elizabeth, and in 1786 he received a pension of 2000 livres from the
royal treasury. He was thus once more attached to the court,
and made himself friends in spite of the reach and tendency of
his unalterable irony; but he quitted it for ever after an unfortunate
and mysterious love affair, and was received into the
house of M. de Vaudreuil. Here in 1783 he had met Mirabeau, with
whom he remained to the last on terms of intimate friendship.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page825" id="page825"></a>825</span>
whom he assisted with money and influence, and one at least
of whose speeches&mdash;that on the Academies&mdash;he wrote.</p>

<p>The outbreak of the Revolution made a profound change in
the relations of Chamfort&rsquo;s life. Theoretically he had long been
a republican, and he now threw himself into the new movement
with almost fanatical ardour, devoting all his small fortune to
the revolutionary propaganda. His old friends of the court he
forgot. &ldquo;Those who pass the river of revolutions,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;have passed the river of oblivion.&rdquo; Until the 31st of August
1791 he was secretary of the Jacobin club; he became a street
orator and entered the Bastille among the first of the storming
party. He worked for the <i>Mercure de France</i>, collaborated with
Ginguené in the <i>Feuille villageoise</i>, and drew up for Talleyrand
his <i>Adresse au peuple français</i>.</p>

<p>With the reign of Marat and Robespierre, however, his uncompromising
Jacobinism grew critical, and with the fall of the
Girondins his political life came to an end. But he could not
restrain the tongue that had made him famous; he no more
spared the Convention than he had spared the court. His
notorious republicanism failed to excuse the sarcasms he lavished
on the new order of things, and denounced by an assistant in
the Bibliothèque Nationale, to a share in the direction of which
he had been appointed by Roland, he was taken to the Madelonnettes.
Released for a moment, he was threatened again
with arrest; but he had determined to prefer death to a repetition
of the moral and physical restraint to which he had been subjected.
He attempted suicide with pistol and with poniard;
and, horribly hacked and shattered, dictated to those who came
to arrest him the well-known declaration&mdash;<i>&rdquo;Moi, Sebastien-Roch-Nicolas
Chamfort, déclare avoir voulu mourir en homme libre plutôt
que d&rsquo;être reconduit en esclave dans une maison d&rsquo;arrêt&rdquo;</i>&mdash;which
he signed in a firm hand and in his own blood. He did not die
at once, but lingered on until the 13th of April 1794 in charge
of a gendarme, for whose wardship he paid a crown a day. To
the Abbé Sieyès Chamfort had given fortune in the title of a
pamphlet (&ldquo;<i>Qu&rsquo;est-ce que le Tiers-État? Tout. Qu&rsquo;a-t-il?
Rien</i>&rdquo;), and to Sieyès did Chamfort retail his supreme sarcasm,
the famous &ldquo;<i>Je m&rsquo;en vais enfin de ce monde où il faut que le c&oelig;ur
se brise ou se bronze.</i>&rdquo; The maker of constitutions followed the
dead wit to the grave.</p>

<p>The writings of Chamfort, which include comedies, political
articles, literary criticisms, portraits, letters, and verses, are
colourless and uninteresting in the extreme. As a talker, however,
he was of extraordinary force. His <i>Maximes et Pensées</i>,
highly praised by John Stuart Mill, are, after those of La Rochefoucauld,
the most brilliant and suggestive sayings that have
been given to the modern world. The aphorisms of Chamfort,
less systematic and psychologically less important than those of
La Rochefoucauld, are as significant in their violence and
iconoclastic spirit of the period of storm and preparation that
gave them birth as the <i>Réflexions</i> in their exquisite restraint and
elaborate subtlety are characteristic of the tranquil elegance of
their epoch; and they have the advantage in richness of colour,
in picturesqueness of phrase, in passion, in audacity. Sainte-Beuve
compares them to &ldquo;well-minted coins that retain their
value,&rdquo; and to keen arrows that &ldquo;<i>arrivent brusquement et sifflent
encore.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>An edition of his works&mdash;<i>&OElig;uvres complètes de Nicolas Chamfort</i>&mdash;Was
published at Paris in five volumes in 1824-1825. Selections&mdash;<i>&OElig;uvres

<p><span class="bold">CHAMIER, FREDERICK<a name="ar123" id="ar123"></a></span> (1796-1870), English novelist, was
the son of an Anglo-Indian official. In 1809 he entered the navy,
and was in active service until 1827. He retired in 1833, and
was promoted to be captain in 1856. On his retirement he
settled near Waltham Abbey, and wrote several nautical novels
on the lines popularized by Marryat, that had considerable
success. These were <i>The Life of a Sailor</i> (1832), <i>Ben Brace</i> (1836),
<i>The Arethusa</i> (1837), <i>Jack Adams</i> (1838), <i>Tom Bowling</i> (1841)
and <i>Jack Malcolm&rsquo;s Log</i> (1846). He wrote a number of other
books, and edited and brought down to 1827 James&rsquo;s <i>Naval
History</i> (1837).</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHAMILLART, MICHEL<a name="ar124" id="ar124"></a></span> (1652-1721), French statesman,
minister of Louis XIV., was born at Paris of a family of the
noblesse of recent elevation. Following the usual career of a
statesman of his time he became in turn councillor of the parlement
of Paris (1676), master of requests (1686), and intendant
of the generality of Rouen (January 1689). Affable, of polished
manners, modest and honest, Chamillart won the confidence of
Madame de Maintenon and pleased the king. In 1690 he was
made intendant of finances, and on the 5th of September 1699
the king appointed him controller-general of finances, to which
he added on the following 7th of January the ministry of war.
From the first Chamillart&rsquo;s position was a difficult one. The
deficit amounted to more than 53 million livres, and the credit
of the state was almost exhausted. He lacked the great intelligence
and energy necessary for the situation, and was unable
to moderate the king&rsquo;s warlike tastes, or to inaugurate economic
reforms. He could only employ the usual expedients of the
time&mdash;the immoderate sale of offices, the debasement of the
coinage (five times in six years), reduction of the rate of interest
on state debts, and increased taxation. He attempted to force
into circulation a kind of paper money, <i>billets de monnaie</i>, but
with disastrous results owing to the state of credit. He studied
Vauban&rsquo;s project for the royal tithe and Boisguillebert&rsquo;s proposition
for the <i>taille</i>, but did not adopt them. In October 1706
he showed the king that the debts immediately due amounted
to 288 millions, and that the deficit already foreseen for 1707
was 160 millions. In October 1707 he saw with consternation
that the revenue for 1708 was already entirely eaten up by
anticipation, so that neither money nor credit remained for 1708.
In these conditions Chamillart, who had often complained of
the overwhelming burden he was carrying, and who had already
wished to retire in 1706, resigned his office of controller-general.
Public opinion attributed to him the ruin of the country, though
he had tried in 1700 to improve the condition of commerce by
the creation of a council of commerce. As secretary of state
for war he had to place in the field the army for the War of the
Spanish Succession, and to reorganize it three times, after the
great defeats of 1704, 1706 and 1708. With an empty treasury
he succeeded only in part, and he frankly warned the king that
the enemy would soon be able to dictate the terms of peace.
He was reproached with having secured the command of the
army which besieged Turin (1706) for his son-in-law, the incapable
duc de la Feuillade. Madame de Maintenon even became hostile
to him, and he abandoned his position on the 10th of June 1709,
retiring to his estates. He died on the 14th of April 1721.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAMINADE, CÉCILE<a name="ar125" id="ar125"></a></span> (1861-&emsp;&emsp;), French musical composer,
was born at Paris on the 8th of August 1861. She studied in
Paris, her musical talent being shown at the age of eight by the
writing of some church music which attracted Bizet&rsquo;s attention;
and at eighteen she came out in public as a pianist. Her own
compositions, both songs (in large numbers) and instrumental
pieces, were soon produced in profusion: melodious and interesting,
and often charming, they became very popular, without
being entitled to rank with the greater style of music. Both
in Paris and in England Mlle Chaminade and her works became
well known at the principal concerts. In 1908 she visited
America and was warmly welcomed.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHAMISSO, ADELBERT VON<a name="ar126" id="ar126"></a></span> [<span class="sc">Louis Charles Adelaide de</span>]
(1781-1838), German poet and botanist, was born at the château
of Boncourt in Champagne, France, the ancestral seat of his
family, on the 30th of January 1781. Driven from France by
the Revolution, his parents settled in Berlin, where in 1796
young Chamisso obtained the post of page-in-waiting to the
queen, and in 1798 entered a Prussian infantry regiment as ensign.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page826" id="page826"></a>826</span>
His family were shortly afterwards permitted to return to France;
he, however, remained behind and continued his career in the
army. He had but little education, but now sought distraction
from the soulless routine of the Prussian military service
in assiduous study. In collaboration with Varnhagen von Ense,
he founded in 1803 the <i>Berliner Musenalmanach</i>, in which his
first verses appeared. The enterprise was a failure, and, interrupted
by the war, it came to an end in 1806. It brought
him, however, to the notice of many of the literary celebrities
of the day and established his reputation as a rising poet. He
had become lieutenant in 1801, and in 1805 accompanied his
regiment to Hameln, where he shared in the humiliations following
the treasonable capitulation of that fortress in the ensuing
year. Placed on parole he went to France, where he found that
both his parents were dead; and, returning to Berlin in the
autumn of 1807, he obtained his release from the service
early in the following year. Homeless and without a profession,
disillusioned and despondent, he lived in Berlin until 1810, when,
through the services of an old friend of the family, he was offered
a professorship at the <i>lycée</i> at Napoléonville in La Vendée. He
set out to take up the post, but drawn into the charmed circle
of Madame de Staël, followed her in her exile to Coppet in
Switzerland, where, devoting himself to botanical research, he
remained nearly two years. In 1812 he returned to Berlin,
where he continued his scientific studies. In the summer of the
eventful year, 1813, he wrote the prose narrative <i>Peter Schlemihl</i>,
the man who sold his shadow. This, the most famous of all his
works, has been translated into most European languages
(English by W. Howitt). It was written partly to divert his
own thoughts and partly to amuse the children of his friend
Hitzig. In 1815 Chamisso was appointed botanist to the Russian
ship &ldquo;Rurik,&rdquo; which Otto von Kotzebue (son of August von
Kotzebue) commanded on a scientific voyage round the world.
His diary of the expedition (<i>Tagebuch</i>, 1821) affords some interesting
glimpses of England and English life. On his return in 1818
he was made custodian of the botanical gardens in Berlin, and
was elected a member of the Academy of Sciences, and in 1820
he married. Chamisso&rsquo;s travels and scientific researches restrained
for a while the full development of his poetical talent,
and it was not until his forty-eighth year that he turned again
to literature. In 1829, in collaboration with Gustav Schwab, and
from 1832 in conjunction with Franz von Gaudy, he brought
out the <i>Deutsche Musenalmanach</i>, in which his later poems were
mainly published. He died on the 21st of August 1838.</p>

<p>As a scientist Chamisso has not left much mark, although his
<i>Bemerkungen und Ansichten</i>, published in an incomplete form
in O. von Kotzebue&rsquo;s <i>Entdeckungsreise</i> (Weimar, 1821) and more
completely in Chamisso&rsquo;s <i>Gesammelte Werke</i> (1836), and the
botanical work, <i>Übersicht der nutzbarsten und schädlichsten
Gewächse in Norddeutschland</i> (1829) are esteemed for their
careful treatment of the subjects with which they deal. As
a poet Chamisso&rsquo;s reputation stands high, <i>Frauen Liebe und
Leben</i> (1830), a cycle of lyrical poems, which was set to music
by Schumann, being particularly famous. Noteworthy are
also <i>Schloss Boncourt</i> and <i>Salas y Gomez</i>. In estimating his
success as a writer, it should not be forgotten that he was cut
off from his native speech and from his natural current of
thought and feeling. He often deals with gloomy and sometimes
with ghastly and repulsive subjects; and even in his
lighter and gayer <span class="correction" title="Amended from proudctions">productions</span> there is an undertone of sadness
or of satire. In the lyrical expression of the domestic emotions
he displays a fine felicity, and he knew how to treat with
true feeling a tale of love or vengeance. <i>Die Löwenbraut</i> may
be taken as a sample of his weird and powerful simplicity; and
<i>Vergeltung</i> is remarkable for a pitiless precision of treatment.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The first collected edition of Chamisso&rsquo;s works was edited by J.E.
Hitzig, 6 vols. (1836); 6th edition (1874); there are also excellent
editions by M. Koch (1883) and O.F. Walzel (1892). On Chamisso&rsquo;s
life see J.E. Hitzig, &ldquo;Leben und Briefe von Adelbert yon Chamisso&rdquo;

<p><span class="bold">CHAMKANNI,<a name="ar127" id="ar127"></a></span> a small Pathan tribe on the Kohat border of
the North-West Province of India. They inhabit the western
part of the Kurmana Valley in the Orakzai portion of Tirah,
but are supposed to be a distinct race. They took part in the
frontier risings of 1897, and during the Tirah expedition of
that year a brigade under General Gaselee was sent to punish
them.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHAMOIS,<a name="ar128" id="ar128"></a></span> the Franco-Swiss name of an Alpine ruminant
known in the German cantons as <i>Gemse</i>, and to naturalists as
<i>Rupicapra tragus</i> or <i>R. rupicapra tragus</i>. It is the only species
of its genus, and typifies a subfamily, <i>Rupicaprinae</i>, of hollow-horned
ruminants in some degree intermediate between antelopes
and goats (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Antelope</a></span>). About equal in height to a roebuck,
and with a short black tail, the chamois is readily distinguishable
from all other ruminants by its vertical, backwardly-hooked,
black horns, which are common to males and females, although
smaller in the latter. Apart from black and white face-markings,
and the black tail and dorsal stripe, the prevailing colour of the
Alpine chamois is chestnut brown in summer, but lighter and
greyer in winter. In the Pyrenees the species is represented by a
small race locally known as the izard; a very brightly-coloured
form, <i>R.t. picta</i>, inhabits the Apennines; the Carpathian
chamois is very dark-coloured, and the one from the Caucasus
is the representative of yet another race. A thick under-fur is
developed in the winter-coat, as in all other ruminants dwelling
at high altitudes. Chamois are gregarious, living in herds of 15
or 20, and feeding generally in the morning or evening. The old
males, however, live alone except in the rutting season, which
occurs in October, when they join the herds, driving off the
younger bucks, and engaging in fierce contests with each other,
that often end fatally for one at least of the combatants. The
period of gestation is twenty weeks, when the female, beneath
the shelter generally of a projecting rock, produces one and
sometimes two young. In summer they ascend to the limits of
perpetual snow, being only exceeded in the loftiness of their
haunts by the ibex; and during that season they show their
intolerance of heat by choosing such browsing-grounds as have
a northern exposure. In winter they descend to the wooded
districts that immediately succeed the region of glaciers, and it
is there only they can be successfully hunted. Chamois are
exceedingly shy; and their senses, especially those of sight and
smell, very acute. The herd never feeds without having a
sentinel posted on some prominence to give notice of the approach
of danger; which is done by stamping on the ground with the
forefeet, and uttering a shrill whistling note, thus putting the
entire herd on the alert. No sooner is the object of alarm scented
or seen than each one seeks safety in the most inaccessible
situations, which are often reached by a series of astounding
leaps over crevasses, up the faces of seemingly perpendicular
rocks, or down the sides of equally precipitous chasms. The
chamois will not hesitate, it is said, thus to leap down 20 or even
30 ft., and this it effects with apparent ease by throwing itself
forward diagonally and striking its feet several times in its
descent against the face of the rock. Chamois-shooting is most
successfully pursued when a number of hunters form a circle
round a favourite feeding ground, which they gradually narrow;
the animals, scenting the hunters to windward, fly in the opposite
direction, only to encounter those coming from leeward.
Chamois-hunting, in spite of, or perhaps owing to the great
danger attending it, has always been a favourite pursuit among
the hardy mountaineers of Switzerland and Tirol, as well as of
the amateur sportsmen of all countries, with the result that the
animal is now comparatively rare in many districts where it was
formerly common. Chamois feed in summer on mountain-herbs
and flowers, and in winter chiefly on the young shoots and buds
of fir and pine trees. They are particularly fond of salt, and
in the Alps sandstone rocks containing a saline impregnation
are often met with hollowed by the constant licking of these
creatures. The skin of the chamois is very soft; made into
leather it was the original <i>shammy</i>, which is now made, however,
from the skins of many other animals. The flesh is prized as
venison.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAMOMILE,<a name="ar129" id="ar129"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Camomile Flowers</span>, the <i>flores anthemidis</i>
of the British Pharmacopoeia, the flower-heads of <i>Anthemis
nobilis</i> (Nat. Ord. <i>Compositae</i>), a herb indigenous to England
and western Europe. It is cultivated for medicinal purposes
in Surrey, at several places in Saxony, and in France and
Belgium,&mdash;that grown in England being much more valuable
than any of the foreign chamomiles brought into the market.
In the wild plant the florets of the ray are ligulate and white,
and contain pistils only, those of the disk being tubular and
yellow; but under cultivation the whole of the florets tend to
become ligulate and white, in which state the flower-heads are
said to be double. The flower-heads have a warm aromatic
odour, which is characteristic of the entire plant, and a very
bitter taste. In addition to a bitter extractive principle, they
yield about 2% of a volatile liquid, which on its first extraction
is of a pale blue colour, but becomes a yellowish brown on
exposure to light. It has the characteristic odour of the flowers,
and consists of a mixture of butyl and amyl angelates and
valerates. Angelate of potassium has been obtained by treatment
of the oil with caustic potash, and angelic acid may be isolated
from this by treatment with dilute sulphuric acid. Chamomile
is used in medicine in the form of its volatile oil, of which the
dose is ½-3 minims. There is an official extract which is never
used. Like all volatile oils the drug is a stomachic and carminative.
In large doses the infusion is a simple emetic.</p>

<p>Wild chamomile is <i>Matricaria Chamomilla</i>, a weed common
in waste and cultivated ground especially in the southern counties
of England. It has somewhat the appearance of true chamomile,
but a fainter scent.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHAMONIX,<a name="ar130" id="ar130"></a></span> a mountain valley in south-east France, its chief
village, of the same name, being the capital of a canton of the
arrondissement of Bonneville in the department of Haute-Savoie.
The valley runs from N.E. to S.W., and is watered by
the Arve, which rises in the Mer de Glace. On the S.E. towers
the snowclad chain of Mont Blanc, and on the N.W. the less lofty,
but rugged chain of the Brévent and of the Aiguilles Rouges.
Near the head of the valley is the village of Argentière (4101
ft.), which is connected with Switzerland by &ldquo;char&rdquo; (light
carriage) roads over the Tête Noire and past Salvan, and by a
mule path over the Col de Balme, which joins the Tête Noire
route near Trient and then crosses by a &ldquo;char&rdquo; road the Col de la
Forclaz to Martigny in the Rhone valley. The principal village,
Chamonix (3416 ft.), is 6 m. below Argentière by electric railway
(which continues via Finhaut to Martigny) and is visited annually
by a host of tourists, as it is the best starting-point for the
exploration of the glaciers of the Mont Blanc chain, as well as
for the ascent of Mont Blanc itself. It is connected with Geneva
by a railway (55 m.). In 1906 the population of the village was
806, of the commune 3482.</p>

<p>The valley is first heard of about 1091, when it was granted by
the count of the Genevois to the great Benedictine house of St
Michel de la Cluse, near Turin, which by the early 13th century
established a priory therein. But in 1786 the inhabitants bought
their freedom from the canons of Sallanches, to whom the priory
had been transferred in 1519. In 1530 the inhabitants obtained
from the count of the Genevois the privilege of holding two fairs
a year, while the valley was often visited by the civil officials and
by the bishops of Geneva (first recorded visit in 1411, while
St Francis de Sales came thither in 1606). But travellers for
pleasure were long rare. The first party to publish (1744) an
account of their visit was that of Dr R. Pococke, Mr W. Windham
and other Englishmen who visited the Mer de Glace in 1741.
In 1742 came P. Martel and several other Genevese, in 1760
H.B. de Saussure, and rather later Bourrit.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAMPAGNE,<a name="ar131" id="ar131"></a></span> an ancient province of the kingdom of France,
bounded N. by Liége and Luxemburg; E. by Lorraine; S. by
Burgundy; and W. by Picardy and Isle de France. It now
forms the departments of Ardennes, Marne, Aube and Haute
Marne, with part of Aisne, Seine-et-Marne, Yonne and Meuse.
Its name&mdash;in Latin Campania, &ldquo;country of plains&rdquo;&mdash;is derived
from the immense plains near Reims, Châlons and Troyes. It
was constituted towards the end of the middle ages by joining
to the countship of Champagne the ecclesiastical duchies of
Reims and Langres, together with the ecclesiastical countship of
Châlons. Documents of the 12th and 13th centuries make it
possible to determine the territorial configuration of the countship
of Champagne with greater accuracy than in the case of any other
fief of the crown of France. Formed at random by the acquisitions
of the counts of the houses of Vermandois and Blois,
Champagne reckoned among its dependencies, from 1152 to 1234,
the countship of Blois and Chartres, of which Touraine was a fief,
the countship of Sancerre, and various scattered fiefs in the
Bourbonnais and in Burgundy. Officially called the &ldquo;countship of
Champagne and Brie&rdquo; since 1217, this state was formed by the
union of the countships of Troyes and Meaux, to which the greater
part of the districts embraced in the country known, since the
beginning of the middle ages, by the name of Champagne and Brie
came in course of time to be attached. Placed under the authority
of a single count in 960, the countships of Troyes and Meaux
were not again separated after 1125. For the counts of Troyes
before the 11th century see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Troyes</a></span>. We confine ourselves here
to the counts of Champagne of the house of Blois.</p>

<p>About 1020 Eudes or Odo I. (Odo II., count of Blois) became
count of Champagne. He disputed the kingdom of Burgundy
with the emperor Conrad, and died in 1037, in a battle near Bar-le-Duc.
In 1037 he was succeeded by his younger son, Stephen
II. About 1050 Odo II., son of Stephen II., became count.
This prince, guilty of murder, found refuge in Normandy, where
he received the castle of Aumale. He took part in 1066 in the
conquest of England, and became earl of Holderness. About
1063 Theobald (Thibaud) I., count of Blois and Meaux, eldest son
of Odo I., became count of Champagne. In 1077 he seized the
countships of Vitry and Bar-sur-Aube, left vacant by Simon of
Valois, who had retired to a monastery. In 1089 Odo III., second
son of Theobald II., became count, and was succeeded about
1093 by his younger brother, Hugh, who became a templar in
1125, and gave up the countship to his suzerain, the count of Blois.
In 1125 the countship of Champagne passed to Theobald II. the
Great, already count of Blois and Meaux, and one of the most
powerful French barons of his time. He was related to the royal
house of England, and incurred the displeasure of the king of
France, who in 1142 invaded Champagne and burnt the town
of Vitry. After Theobald the Great the countship of Blois ceased
to be the dominant fief of his house and became the appanage
of a younger branch. In 1152 Henry the Liberal, eldest son of
Theobald II., became count of Champagne; he married Mary,
daughter of Louis VII. of France, and went to the crusade in 1178.
He was taken prisoner by the Turks, recovered his liberty through
the good offices of the emperor of the East, and died a few days
after his return to Champagne. In 1181 his eldest son, Henry II.,
succeeded him under the tutelage of Mary of France. In 1190
he went to the Holy Land, and became king of Jerusalem in 1192
by his marriage with Isabelle, widow of the marquis of Montferrat.
He died in 1197 in his town of Acre from the results of an
accident. In 1197 Theobald III., younger son of Henry I., became
count, and was succeeded in 1201 by Theobald IV., &ldquo;le
Chansonnier&rdquo; (the singer), who was the son of Theobald III. and
Blanche of Navarre, and was born some days after the death of
his father. From 1201 to 1222 he remained under the tutelage
of his mother, who governed Champagne with great sagacity.
The reign of this prince was singularly eventful. The two
daughters of count Henry II. successively claimed the countship,
so that Theobald had to combat the claims of Philippa, wife of
Erard of Brienne, seigneur of Rameru, from 1216 to 1222, and
those of Alix, queen dowager of Cyprus, in 1233 and 1234. In
1226 he followed king Louis VII. to the siege of Avignon, and after
the death of that monarch played a prominent part during the
reign of St Louis. At first leagued with the malcontent barons,
he allowed himself to be gained over by the queen-mother, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page828" id="page828"></a>828</span>
thus came into collision with his old allies. He became king of
Navarre in 1234 by the death of his maternal uncle, Sancho VII.
but by the onerous treaty which he concluded in that year with
the queen of Cyprus he was compelled to cede to the king, in return
for a large sum of money, the overlordship of the countships of
Blois, Chartres and Sancerre, and the viscounty of Châteaudun.
In 1239 and 1240 he took part in an expedition to the Holy Land,
probably accompanied St Louis in 1242 in the campaign of
Saintonge against the English, and died on the 14th of July 1254
at Pampeluna. If the author of the <i>Grandes chroniques de
France</i> can be believed, Theobald IV. conceived a passion for
Queen Blanche, the mother of St Louis,&mdash;a passion which she
returned, and which explains the changes in his policy; but this
opinion apparently must be relegated to the category of historical
fables. The witty and courtly songs he composed place him in
the front rank of the poets of that class, in which he showed
somewhat more originality than his rivals. In 1254 Theobald V.
the Young, eldest son of Theobald IV. and, like his father, king
of Navarre, became count of Champagne. He married Isabelle of
France, daughter of St Louis, and followed his father-in-law to
Tunis to the crusade, dying on his return. In 1270 he was
succeeded by Henry III. the Fat, king of Navarre. Henry was
succeeded in 1274 by his only daughter, Joan of Navarre, under
the tutelage of her mother, Blanche of Artois, and afterwards of
Edmund, earl of Lancaster, her mother&rsquo;s second husband. In
1284 she married the heir-presumptive to the throne of France,
Philip the Fair, to whom she brought the countship of Champagne
as well as the kingdom of Navarre. She became queen of France
in 1285, and died on the 4th of April 1305, when her eldest son
by King Philip, Louis Hutin, became count of Champagne. He
was the last independent count of the province, which became
attached to the French crown on his accession to the throne of
France in 1314.</p>

<p>The celebrated fairs of Champagne, which flourished in the 12th
and 13th centuries, were attended by merchants from all parts
of civilized Europe. They were six in number: two at Troyes,
two at Provins, one at Lagny-sur-Marne, and one at Bar-sur-Aube.
They formed a kind of continuous market, divided into
six periods, and passed in turn from Lagny to Bar, from Bar to
Provins, from Provins to Troyes, from Troyes to Provins and
from Provins to Troyes, to complete the year. It was, in fact,
a perpetual fair, which had at once unity and variety, offering to
the different parts of the countship the means of selling successively
the special productions of their soil or their industry, and of
procuring in exchange riches and comforts. These fairs had
special legislation; and special magistrates, called &ldquo;masters of
the fairs,&rdquo; had control of the police.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAMPAGNY, JEAN BAPTISTE NOMPÈRE DE<a name="ar132" id="ar132"></a></span> (1756-1834),
French politician, was born at Roanne, and entered the navy in
1774. He fought through the war in America and resigned in
1787. Elected deputy by the <i>noblesse</i> of Forex to the states-general
in 1789, he went over to the third estate on the 21st of
June and collaborated in the work of the Constituent Assembly,
especially occupying himself with the reorganization of the navy.
A political career seems to have attracted him little; he remained
in private life from 1791 to 1799, when Napoleon named him
member of the council of state. From July 1801 to August 1804
he was ambassador of France at Vienna, and directed with great
intelligence the incessant negotiations between the two courts.
In August 1804 Napoleon made him minister of the interior, and
in this position, which he held for three years, he proved an
administrator of the first order. In addition to the ordinary
charges of his office, he had to direct the recruitment of the army,
organize the industrial exhibition of 1808, and to complete the
public works undertaken in Paris and throughout France. He
was devoted to Napoleon, on whom he lavished adulation in his
speeches. In August 1807 the emperor chose him to succeed
Talleyrand as minister for foreign affairs. He directed the
annexation of the Papal States in April 1808, worked to secure the
abdication of Charles IV. of Spain in May 1808, negotiated the
peace of Vienna (1809) and the marriage of Napoleon. In April
1811 a quarrel with the emperor led to his retirement, and he
obtained the sinecure office of intendant general of the crown.
In 1814, after the abdication, the empress sent him on a fruitless
mission to the emperor of Austria. Then he went over to the
Bourbons. During the Hundred Days he again joined Napoleon.
This led to his exclusion by Louis XVIII., but in 1819 he recovered
his dignity of peer. He died in Paris in 1834. He had
three sons who became men of distinction. François (1804-1882)
was a well-known author, who was made a member of the
French Academy in 1869. His great work was a history of the
Roman empire, in three parts, (1) <i>Les Césars</i> (1841-1843, 4 vols.),
(2) <i>Les Antonins</i> (1863, 3 vols.), (3) <i>Les Césars du IIIe siècle</i>
(1870, 3 vols.). Napoléon (1806-1872) published a <i>Traité de la
police municipale</i> in 4 volumes (1844-1861), and was a deputy in
the Corps Législatif from 1852 to 1870. Jérome Paul (1809-1886)
was also deputy in the Corps Législatif from 1853 to 1870,
and was made honorary chamberlain in 1859. He worked at the
official publication of the correspondence of Napoleon I.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAMPAIGN,<a name="ar133" id="ar133"></a></span> a city of Champaign county, Illinois, U.S.A.,
about 125 m. S. by W. of Chicago, on the head-waters of the
Vermilion river. Pop. (1890) 5839; (1900) 9098, of whom 973
were foreign-born; (1910 census) 12,421. It is served by the
Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago &amp; St Louis, the Wabash, and
the Illinois Central railways (the last having repair shops here),
and by the Illinois (electric) Traction System from Danville,
Illinois, to St Louis, Missouri. In 1906 the city covered 3.5 sq. m.;
it is situated in a rich agricultural region, and has small manufacturing
interests. Immediately east of Champaign is the city
of Urbana, the county-seat of Champaign county, served by
the Wabash and the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago &amp; St Louis
railways, with repair shops of the latter. In 1890 the population
of Urbana was 3511; in 1900, 5728 (300 foreign-born); in 1910,
8245. Partly in Urbana and partly in Champaign is the University
of Illinois (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Illinois</a></span>); immediately south of its
campus is the 400-acre farm of the university. Each city has a
public library, and in Champaign are the Burnham Athenaeum,
the Burnham hospital, the Garwood home for old ladies, and
several parks, all gifts of former citizens. Champaign was
founded in 1855, incorporated as a city in 1860, and re-chartered
in 1883. Urbana secured a city charter in 1855.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAMPAIGNE, PHILIPPE DE<a name="ar134" id="ar134"></a></span> (1602-1674), Belgian painter
of the French school, was born at Brussels of a poor family. He
was a pupil of J. Fouquières; and, going to Paris in 1621, was
employed by N. Du Chesne to paint along with Nicholas Poussin
in the palace of the Luxembourg. His best works are to be
found at Vincennes, and in the church of the Carmelites at Paris,
where is his celebrated Crucifix, a signal perspective success, on
one of the vaultings. After the death of Du Chesne, Philippe
became first painter to the queen of France, and ultimately
rector of the Academy of Paris. As his age advanced and his
health failed, he retired to Port Royal, where he had a daughter
cloistered as a nun, of whom (along with Catherine Agnès Arnauld)
he painted a celebrated picture, now in the Louvre, highly remarkable
for its solid unaffected truth. This, indeed, is the general
character of his work,&mdash;grave reality, without special elevation or
depth of character, or charm of warm or stately colour. He produced
an immense number of paintings, religious and other
subjects as well as portraits, dispersed over various parts of
France, and now over the galleries of Europe. Philippe was a
good man, indefatigable, earnest and scrupulously religious.
He died on the 12th of August 1674.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAMPARAN,<a name="ar135" id="ar135"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Chumparun</span>, a district of British India,
in the Patna division of Bengal, occupying the north-west
corner of Behar, between the two rivers Gandak and Baghmati
and the Nepal hills. It has an area of 3531 sq. m. In 1901 the
population was 1,790,463, showing a decrease of 4% in the
decade. A broad grass-covered road or embankment defines the
Nepal frontier, except where rivers or streams form a natural
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page829" id="page829"></a>829</span>
boundary. The district is a vast level except in the N. and N.W.,
where it undulates, and gradually assumes a rugged appearance
as it approaches the mountains and forests of Nepal. Wide
uncultivated tracts cover its north-western corner; the southern
and western parts are carefully cultivated, and teem with an
active agricultural population. The principal rivers are the
Gandak, navigable all the year round, the Buri Gandak, Panch
Nadi, Lalbagia, Koja and Teur. Old beds of rivers intersect
Champaran in every direction, and one of these forms a chain
of lakes which occupy an area of 139 sq. m. in the centre of the
district. Champaran, with the rest of Bengal and Behar, was
acquired by the British in 1765. Up to 1866 it remained a
subdivision of Saran. In that year it was separated and formed
into a separate district. The administrative headquarters are
at Motihari (population, 13,730); Bettia is the centre of a very
large estate; Segauli, still a small military station, was the
scene of a massacre during the Mutiny. Champaran was the
chief seat of indigo planting in Behar before the decline of that
industry. There are about 40 saltpetre refineries. The district
suffered severely from drought in 1866 and 1874, and again in
1897. In the last year a small government canal was opened,
and a canal from the Gandak has also been constructed. The
district is traversed almost throughout its length to Bettia by
the Tirhoot state railway. A considerable trade is conducted
with Nepal.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAMPEAUX, WILLIAM OF<a name="ar136" id="ar136"></a></span> [<span class="sc">Gulielmus Campellensis</span>]
(c. 1070-1121), French philosopher and theologian was born
at Champeaux near Melun. After studying under Anselm of
Laon and Roscellinus, he taught in the school of the cathedral
of Notre Dame, of which he was made canon in 1103. Among
his pupils was Abelard. In 1108 he retired into the abbey of
St Victor, where he resumed his lectures. He afterwards
became bishop of Châlons-sur-Marne, and took part in the
dispute concerning investitures as a supporter of Calixtus II.,
whom he represented at the conference of Mousson. His only
printed works are a fragment on the Eucharist (inserted by
Jean Mabillon in his edition of the works of St Bernard), and the
<i>Moralia Abbreviata</i> and <i>De Origine Animae</i> (in E. Martène&rsquo;s
<i>Thesaurus novus Anecdotorum</i>, 1717, vol. 5). In the last of
these he maintains that children who die unbaptized must be lost,
the pure soul being denied by the grossness of the body, and
declares that God&rsquo;s will is not to be questioned. He upholds
the theory of Creatianism (that a soul is specially created for
each human being). Ravaisson-Mollien has discovered a
number of fragments by him, among which the most important is the
<i>De Essentia Dei et de Substantia Dei</i>; a <i>Liber Sententiarum</i>,
consisting of discussions on ethics and Scriptural interpretation,
is also ascribed to Champeaux. He is reputed the founder of
Realism. For his views and his controversy with Abelard, see

<p><span class="bold">CHAMPERTY,<a name="ar137" id="ar137"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Champarty</span> (Lat. <i>campi partitio</i>, O. Fr.
<i>champ parti</i>), in English law, a bargain between a plaintiff or
defendant in a cause and another person, to divide the land
(<i>campum partiri</i>) or other matter sued for, if they prevail, in
consideration of that person carrying on or defending the suit
at his own expense. It is a misdemeanour punishable by fine
or imprisonment. It differs only from maintenance (<i>q.v.</i>), in
that the recompense for the service which has been given is
always part of the matter in suit, or some profit growing out of
it. So an agreement by a solicitor not to charge costs on
condition of retaining for himself a share of the sums recovered
would be illegal and void. It is not, however, champerty to
charge the subject-matter of a suit in order to obtain the means
of prosecuting it.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAMPION<a name="ar138" id="ar138"></a></span> (Fr. <i>champion</i>, Late Lat. <i>campio</i> from <i>campus</i>,
a field or open space, <i>i.e.</i> one &ldquo;who takes the field&rdquo; or fights;
cf. Ger. <i>Kampf</i>, battle, and <i>Kämpfer</i>, fighter), in the
judicial combats of the middle ages the substitute for a party to the suit
disabled from bearing arms or specially exempt from the duty
to do so (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Wager</a></span>). Hence the word has come to be applied
to any one who &ldquo;champions,&rdquo; or contends on behalf of, any
person or cause. In the laws of the Lombards (lib. ii. tit. 56
§§ 38, 39), those who by reason of youth, age or infirmity could
not bear arms were allowed to nominate champions, and the
same provision was made in the case of women (lib. i. tit.
3 § 6, tit. 16, §2). This was practically the rule laid down in all
subsequent legislation on the subject. Thus the <i>Assize of
Jerusalem</i> (cap. 39) says: &ldquo;These are the people who may defend
themselves through champions; a woman, a sick man, a man
who has passed the age of sixty, &amp;c.&rdquo; The clergy, too, whether
as individuals or corporations, were represented by champions;
in the case of bishops and abbots this function was part of the
duties of the <i>advocatus</i> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Advocate</a></span>). Du Cange gives
instances of mercenary champions (<i>campiones conductitii</i>), who
were regarded as &ldquo;infamous persons&rdquo; and sometimes, in case
of defeat, were condemned to lose hand or foot. Sometimes
championships were &ldquo;serjeanties,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> rendered service to lords,
churches or cities in consideration of the grant of certain fiefs, or
for annual money payments, the champion doing homage to the
person or corporation represented by him (<i>campiones homagii</i>).</p>

<p>The office of &ldquo;king&rsquo;s champion&rdquo; (<i>campio regis</i>) is peculiar
to England. The function of the king&rsquo;s champion, when the
ceremonial of the coronation was carried out in its completeness,
was to ride, clad in complete armour, on his right the high
constable, on his left the earl marshal, into Westminster Hall
during the coronation banquet, and challenge to single combat
any who should dispute the king&rsquo;s right to reign. The challenge
was thrice repeated by the herald, at the entrance to the hall,
in the centre, and at the foot of the dais. On picking up his
gauntlet for the third time the champion was pledged by the
king in a gilt-covered cup, which was then presented to him as
his fee by the king. If he had had occasion to fight, and was
victorious, his fee would have been the armour he wore and the
horse he rode, the second best in the royal stables; but no such
occasion has ever arisen. This picturesque ceremonial was last
performed at the coronation of George IV. The office of king&rsquo;s
champion is of great antiquity, and its origins are involved in
great obscurity. It is said to have been held under William the
Conqueror by Robert or Roger Marmion, whose ancestors had
been hereditary champions in Normandy. The first authentic
record, however is a charter of Henry I., signed by Robert
Marmion (<i>Robertus de Bajucis campio regis</i>). Of the actual
exercise of the office the earliest record dates from the coronation
of Richard II. On this occasion the champion, Sir John Dymoke,
appeared at the door of the Abbey immediately after the coronation
mass, but was peremptorily told to go away and return
later; moreover, in his bill presented to the court of claims, he
stated that the champion was to ride in the procession before
the service, and make his challenge to all the world. This seems
to show that the ceremony, as might be expected, was originally
performed <i>before</i> the king&rsquo;s coronation, when it would have had
some significance. The office of king&rsquo;s champion is hereditary,
and is now held by the family of Dymoke (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAMPIONNET, JEAN ÉTIENNE<a name="ar139" id="ar139"></a></span> (1762-1800), French
general, enlisted in the army at an early age and served in the
great siege of Gibraltar. When the Revolution broke out he
took a prominent part in the movement, and was elected by the
men of a battalion to command them. In May 1793 he was
charged with the suppression of the disturbances in the Jura,
which he quelled without bloodshed. Under Pichegru he took
part in the Rhine campaign of that year as a brigade commander,
and at Weissenburg and in the Palatinate won the warm commendation
of Lazare Hoche. At Fleurus his stubborn fighting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page830" id="page830"></a>830</span>
in the centre of the field contributed greatly to Jourdan&rsquo;s victory.
In the subsequent campaigns he commanded the left wing of the
French armies on the Rhine between Neuwied and Düsseldorf,
and took a great part in all the successful and unsuccessful
expeditions to the Lahn and the Main. In 1798 Championnet
was named commander-in-chief of the &ldquo;army of Rome&rdquo; which
was protecting the infant Roman republic against the Neapolitan
court and the British fleet. Nominally 32,000 strong, the army
scarcely numbered 8000 effectives, with a bare fifteen cartridges
per man. The Austrian general Mack had a tenfold superiority
in numbers, but Championnet so well held his own that he ended
by capturing Naples itself and there setting up the Parthenopean
Republic. But his intense earnestness and intolerance of
opposition soon embroiled him with the civilians, and the
general was recalled in disgrace. The following year, however,
saw him again in the field as commander-in-chief of the &ldquo;army
of the Alps.&rdquo; This, too, was at first a mere paper force, but after
three months&rsquo; hard work it was able to take the field. The
campaign which followed was uniformly unsuccessful, and,
worn out by the unequal struggle, Championnet died at Antibes
on the 9th of January 1800. In 1848 a statue was erected in his
honour at Valence.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAMPLAIN, SAMUEL DE<a name="ar140" id="ar140"></a></span> (1567-1635), French explorer,
colonial pioneer and first governor of French Canada, was born
at Brouage, a small French port on the Bay of Biscay, in 1567.
His father was a sea captain, and the boy was early skilled in
seamanship and navigation. He entered the army of Henry IV.,
and served in Brittany under Jean d&rsquo;Aumont, François de St
Luc and Charles de Brissac. When the army of the League
was disbanded he accompanied his uncle, who had charge of the
ships in which the Spanish allies were conveyed home, and on
reaching Cadiz secured (1599) the command of one of the vessels
about to make an expedition to the West Indies. He was gone
over two years, visiting all the principal ports and pushing
inland from Vera Cruz to the city of Mexico. The MS. account
of his adventures, <i>Bref Discours des Choses plus remarquables
que Samuel Champlain de Brouage a recognues aux Indes Occidentales</i>,
is in the library at Dieppe. It was not published in
French until 1870, although an English translation was printed
by the Hakluyt Society in 1859. It contains a suggestion of a
Panama Canal, &ldquo;by which the voyage to the South Sea would
be shortened by more than 1500 leagues.&rdquo; In 1603 Champlain
made his first voyage to Canada, being sent out by Aymar de
Clermont, seigneur de Chastes, on whom the king had bestowed
a patent. Champlain at once established friendly relations
with the Indians and explored the St Lawrence to the rapids
above Montreal. On his return he published an interesting
and historically valuable little book, <i>Des sauvages, ou voyage de
Samuel Champlain de Brouage fait en la France Nouvelle</i>. During
his absence de Chastes had died, and his privileges and fur trade
monopolies were conferred upon Pierre de Guast, sieur de Monts
(1560-1611). With him, in 1604, Champlain was engaged in
exploring the coast as far south as Cape Cod, in seeking a site
for a new settlement, and in making surveys and charts. They
first settled on an island near the mouth of the St Croix river,
and then at Port Royal&mdash;now Annapolis, N.S.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Basques and Bretons, asserting that they were
being ruined by de Monts&rsquo; privileges, got his patent revoked,
and Champlain returned with the discouraged colonists to Europe.
When, however, in modified form, the patent was re-granted to
his patron Champlain induced him to abandon Acadia and
establish a settlement on the St Lawrence, of the commercial
advantages of which, perhaps even as a western route to China
and Japan, he soon convinced him. Champlain was placed in
command of one of the two vessels sent out. He was to explore
and colonize, while the other vessel traded, to pay for the expedition.
Champlain fixed on the site of Quebec and founded
the first white settlement there in July 1608, giving it its present
name. In the spring he joined a war party of Algonquins and
Hurons, discovered the great lake that bears his name, and, near
the present Ticonderoga, took with his arquebus an important
part in the victory which his savage friends obtained over the
Iroquois. The Iroquois naturally turned first to the Dutch and
then to the English for allies. &ldquo;Thus did new France rush into
collision with the redoubted warriors of the Five Nations. Here
was the beginning, and in some measure doubtless the cause, of
a long suite of murderous conflicts, bearing havoc and flame to
generations yet unborn&rdquo; (Parkman). Champlain returned to
France and again related to Henry IV.&mdash;who had previously
learned his worth and had pensioned him&mdash;his exciting adventures.
De Monts failed to secure a renewal of his patent, but resolved
to proceed without it. Champlain was again (1611) in Canada,
fighting for and against the Indians and establishing a trading
post at Mont Royal (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Montreal</a></span>). He was the third white
man to descend, and the second to descend successfully, the
Lachine Rapids. De Monts, now governor of Paris, was too busy
to occupy himself in the waning fortunes of the colony, and left
them entirely to his associate. An influential protector was
needed; and Champlain prevailed upon Charles de Bourbon,
comte de Soissons, to interest himself to obtain from the king
the appointment of lieutenant-general in New France. The
comte de Soissons died almost immediately, and was succeeded
in the office by Henri de Bourbon, prince de Condé, and he, like
his predecessors and successors, retained Champlain as lieutenant-governor.
&ldquo;In Champlain alone was the life of New France.
By instinct and temperament he was more impelled to the
adventurous toils of exploration than to the duller task of
building colonies. The profits of trade had value in his eyes only
as means to these ends, and settlements were important chiefly
as a base of discovery. Two great objects eclipsed all others,&mdash;to
find a route to the Indies, and to bring the heathen tribes
into the embraces of the Church, since, while he cared little for
their bodies, his solicitude for their souls knew no bounds&rdquo;
(Parkman).</p>

<p>In 1613 Champlain again crossed the Atlantic and endeavoured
to confirm Nicolas de Vignau&rsquo;s alleged discovery of a short route
to the ocean by the Ottawa river, a great lake at its source, and
another river flowing north therefrom. That year he got as
far as Allumette Island in the Ottawa, but two years later, with
a &ldquo;Great War Party&rdquo; of Indians, he crossed Lake Nipissing
and the eastern ends of Lakes Huron and Ontario, and made a
fierce but unsuccessful attack on an Onondaga fortified town
a few miles south of Lake Oneida. This was the end of his
wanderings. He now devoted himself to the growth and
strengthening of Quebec. Every year he went to France with
this end in view. He was one of the hundred associates of the
Company of New France, created by Richelieu to reform abuses
and take over all his country&rsquo;s interests in the new world. These
ill-defended possessions England now prepared to seize. Three
ships were sent out under letters of marque commanded by
David, Lewis and Thomas Kirke, and Quebec, already on the
verge of starvation, was compelled to surrender (1629). Champlain
was taken to England a prisoner, but when Canada was
restored to the French he returned (1633) to his post, where he
died on the 25th of December 1635. He had married in 1610,
Hélène Boullé, then but twelve years old. She did not leave
France for Canada, however, until ten years later. After his
death she became a nun.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAMPLAIN,<a name="ar141" id="ar141"></a></span> a lake lying between the states of New York
and Vermont, U.S.A., and penetrating for a few miles into
Canada. It extends about 130 m. from N. to S., varies from
¼ m. to 1 m. in width for 40 m. from its S. terminus, and then
widens until it reaches a maximum width of about 11 m. near
Ausable Point. Its area is about 500 sq. m. Its surface is 96
ft. above the sea. In the north part it is generally from 200 to
300 ft. deep; opposite Essex, N.Y., near its middle, the depth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page831" id="page831"></a>831</span>
increases to 400 ft.; but farther south it is much less; throughout
the greater part of the lake there is a depth of water of more
than 100 ft. Since the lake is caused by the ponding of water
in a broad irregular valley, the shore line is nearly everywhere
much broken, and in the northern portion are several islands,
both large and small, most of which belong to Vermont. These
islands divide the lake&rsquo;s northern end into two large arms
which extend into Canada. From the western arm the Richelieu
river flows out, carrying the water of Champlain to the St
Lawrence. The waters abound in salmon, salmon-trout, sturgeon
and other fish, and are navigated from end to end by large
steamboats and vessels of considerable tonnage. The lake
was formerly the seat of extensive traffic, especially in lumber,
but navigation has greatly decreased; the tonnage entering and
clearing at the lake was twice as great in the early &rsquo;70&rsquo;s as it
was thirty years later. The principal ports are Burlington, Vt.,
and Plattsburg, N.Y. Lake Champlain lies in a valley from 1 to
30 m. wide, between the Green Mountains on the east and the
Adirondack Mountains on the west, and the scenery is most
picturesque. On the east side is a rather gradual ascent for 20 m.
or more from shore to summit, while on the west side the ascent
is by a succession of hills, in some places from the water&rsquo;s edge.
North of Crown Point low mountains rise 1000 to 1600 ft. above
the lake, and behind these are the higher peaks of the Adirondacks,
reaching an elevation of more than 5000 ft. Lake George is
a tributary on the south, several small streams flow in from each
side; the Champlain Canal, 63 m. in length, connects the lake
with the Hudson river; and through the Richelieu it has a
natural outlet to the north into the St Lawrence.</p>

<p>Lake Champlain was named from Samuel de Champlain, who
discovered it in July 1609. The valley is a natural pathway
between the United States and Canada, and during the various
wars which the English have waged in America it had great
strategic importance. In 1731 the French built a fort at Crown
Point; in 1756, another at Ticonderoga; and both were important
strategic points in the French and Indian War as well as in
the American War of Independence. On the 11th of October
1776, the first battle between an American and a British fleet,
the battle of Valcour Island, was fought on the lake. Benedict
Arnold, the American commander, with a decidedly inferior
force, withstood the British under Thomas Pringle for about
seven hours, and then during the night escaped through the
enemy&rsquo;s line. Although overtaken the next day he again, after
a fight of a few hours, made a successful retreat.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the War of 1812 the American naval
force on the lake, though very small, was superior to that of the
British, but on the 3rd of June 1813 the British captured two
American sloops in the narrow channel at the northern end and
gained supremacy. Both sides now began to build and equip
vessels for a decisive contest; by May 1814 the Americans
had regained supremacy, and four months later a British land
force of 11,000 men under Sir George Prevost (1767-1816) and a
naval force of 16 vessels of about 2402 tons with 937 men and
92 guns under Captain George Downie (d. 1814) confronted an
American land force of 1500 men under Brigadier-General
Alexander Macomb (1782-1841), strongly entrenched at Plattsburg,
and an American naval force (anchored in Plattsburg Bay)
of 14 vessels of about 2244 tons with 882 men and 86 guns under
Commodore Thomas Macdonough (1783-1825). In the open
lake the British naval force should have been the superior, but
at anchor in the bay the Americans had a decided advantage.
Expecting the British land force to drive the American fleet
from its anchorage, Captain Downie, on the 11th of September
1814, began the battle of Lake Champlain. It had continued
only fifteen minutes when he was killed; the land force failed
to co-operate, and after a severe fight at close range for 2½ hours,
during which the British lost about 300 men, the Americans 200
and the vessels of both sides were greatly shattered, the British
retreated both by land and by water, abandoning their plan of
invading New York.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAMPMESLÉ, MARIE<a name="ar142" id="ar142"></a></span> (1642-1698), French actress, was
born in Rouen of a good family. Her father&rsquo;s name was Desmares.
She made her first appearance on the stage at Rouen with
Charles Chevillet (1645-1701), who called himself sieur de
Champmeslé, and they were married in 1666. By 1669 they
were playing in Paris at the Théatre du Marais, her first appearance
there being as Venus in Boyer&rsquo;s <i>Fête de Venus</i>. The next
year, as Hermione in Racine&rsquo;s <i>Andromaque</i>, she had a great
success at the Hôtel de Bourgogne. Her intimacy with Racine
dates from then. Some of his finest tragedies were written for
her, but her repertoire was not confined to them, and many an
indifferent play&mdash;like Thomas Corneille&rsquo;s <i>Ariane</i> and <i>Comte
d&rsquo;Essex</i>&mdash;owed its success to &ldquo;her natural manner of acting,
and her pathetic rendering of the hapless heroine.&rdquo; <i>Phèdre</i>
was the climax of her triumphs, and when she and her husband
deserted the Hôtel de Bourgogne (see BÉJART <i>ad fin.</i>), it was
selected to open the Comédie Française on the 26th of August
1680. Here, with Mme Guérin as the leading comedy actress,
she played the great tragic love parts for more than thirty years,
dying on the 15th of May 1698. La Fontaine dedicated to her
his novel <i>Belphégor</i>, and Boileau immortalized her in verse.
Her husband distinguished himself both as actor and playwright,
and his <i>Parisien</i> (1682) gave Mme Guérin one of her greatest
successes.</p>

<p>Her brother, the actor <span class="sc">Nicolas Desmares</span> (c. 1650-1714),
began as a member of a subsidized company at Copenhagen, but
by her influence he came to Paris and was received in 1685
<i>sans début</i>&mdash;the first time such an honour had been accorded&mdash;at
the Comédie Française, where he became famous for peasant
parts. His daughter, to whom Christian V. and his queen stood
sponsors, <span class="sc">Christine Antoinette Charlotte Desmares</span> (1682-1753),
was a fine actress in both tragedy and soubrette parts.
She made her début at the Comédie Française in 1699, in La
Grange Chancel&rsquo;s <i>Oreste et Pylade</i>, and was at once received as
<i>sociétaire</i>. She retired in 1721.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAMPOLLION, JEAN FRANÇOIS<a name="ar143" id="ar143"></a></span> (1790-1832), French
Egyptologist, called <span class="sc">Le Jeune</span> to distinguish him from Champollion-Figeac
(<i>q.v.</i>), his elder brother, was born at Figeac, in the
department of Lot, on the 23rd of December 1790. He was
educated by his brother, and was then appointed government
pupil at the Lyceum, which had recently been founded. His
first work (1804) was an attempt to show by means of their
names that the giants of the Bible and of Greek mythology were
personifications of natural phenomena. At the age of sixteen
(1807) he read before the academy of Grenoble a paper in which
he maintained that the Coptic was the ancient language of
Egypt. He soon after removed to Paris, where he enjoyed the
friendship of Langlès, De Sacy and Millin. In 1809 he was
made professor of history in the Lyceum of Grenoble, and there
published his earlier works. Champollion&rsquo;s first decipherment
of hieroglyphics dates from 1821. In 1824 he was sent by Charles
X. to visit the collections of Egyptian antiquities in the museums
of Turin, Leghorn, Rome and Naples; and on his return he
was appointed director of the Egyptian museum at the Louvre.
In 1828 he was commissioned to undertake the conduct of a
scientific expedition to Egypt in company with Rosellini, who
had received a similar appointment from Leopold II., grand
duke of Tuscany. He remained there about a year. In March
1831 he received the chair of Egyptian antiquities, which had
been created specially for him, in the Collège de France. He
was engaged with Rosellini in publishing the results of Egyptian
researches at the expense of the Tuscan and French governments,
when he was seized with a paralytic disorder, and died at Paris
in 1832. Champollion, whose claims were hotly disputed for
many years after his death, is now universally acknowledged
to have been the founder of Egyptology.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAMPOLLION-FIGEAC, JACQUES JOSEPH<a name="ar144" id="ar144"></a></span> (1778-1867),
French archaeologist, elder brother of Jean François Champollion,
was born at Figeac in the department of Lot, on the
5th of October 1778. He became professor of Greek and librarian
at Grenoble, but was compelled to retire in 1816 on account of
the part he had taken during the Hundred Days. He afterwards
became keeper of manuscripts at the Bibliothèque Nationale in
Paris, and professor of palaeography at the École des Chartes.
In 1849 he became librarian of the palace of Fontainebleau.
He edited several of his brother&rsquo;s works, and was also author of
original works on philological and historical subjects, among
which may be mentioned <i>Nouvelles recherches sur les patois ou
idiomes vulgaires de la France</i> (1809), <i>Annales de Lagides</i> (1819)
and <i>Chartes latines sur papyrus du VI<span class="sp">e</span> siècle de l&rsquo;ère chrétienne</i>.

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHANCE<a name="ar145" id="ar145"></a></span> (through the O. Fr. <i>chéance</i>, from the Late Lat.
<i>cadentia</i>, things happening, from <i>cadere</i>, to fall out, happen;
cf. &ldquo;case&rdquo;), an accident or event, a phenomenon which has no
apparent or discoverable cause; hence an event which has not
been expected, a piece of good or bad fortune. From the popular
idea that anything of which no assignable cause is known has
therefore no cause, chance (Gr. <span class="grk" title="tuchê">&#964;&#973;&#967;&#951;</span>) was regarded as having a
substantial objective existence, being itself the source of such
uncaused phenomena. For the philosophic theories relating to
this subject see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Accidentalism</a></span>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chance,&rdquo; in the theory of probability, is used in two ways.
In the stricter, or mathematical usage, it is synonymous with
probability; <i>i.e.</i> if a particular event may occur in <i>n</i> ways in an
aggregate of <i>p</i> events, then the &ldquo;chance&rdquo; of the particular event
occurring is given by the fraction <i>n/p</i>. In the second usage, the
&ldquo;chance&rdquo; is regarded as the ratio of the number of ways which
a particular event may occur to the number of ways in which it
may not occur; mathematically expressed, this chance is
<i>n/(p-n)</i> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Probability</a></span>). In the English law relating to gaming
and wagering a distinction is drawn between games of chance
and games of skill (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Gaming and Wagering</a></span>).</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHANCEL<a name="ar146" id="ar146"></a></span> (through O. Fr. from Lat. plur. <i>cancelli</i>, dim. of
<i>cancer</i>, grating, lattice, probably connected with an Indo-European
root <i>Kar</i>-, to bend; cf. circus, curve, &amp;c.), in the
earliest and strictest sense that part of a church near the altar
occupied by the deacons and sub-deacons assisting the officiating
priest, this space having originally been separated from the rest
of the church by <i>cancelli</i> or lattice work. The word <i>cancelli</i> is
used in classical Latin of a screen, bar or the like, set to mark
off an enclosed space in a building or in an open place. It is
thus used of the bar in a court of justice (Cicero, <i>Verres</i>, ii. 3 seq.).
It is particularly used of the lattice or screen in the ancient
basilica, which separated the <i>bema</i>, or raised tribunal, from the
rest of the building. The use of the name in ecclesiastical
buildings is thus natural, for the altar stood in the place occupied
by the <i>bema</i> in the apse of the basilica. From the screen the
term was early transferred to the space <i>inter cancellos</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the
<i>locus altaris cancellis septus</i>. This railed-off space is now generally
known among Roman Catholics as the &ldquo;sanctuary,&rdquo; the
word chancel being little used. In the Church of England,
however, the word chancel survived the Reformation, and is
applied, both in the ecclesiastical and the architectural sense,
to that part of the church occupied by the principal altar or
communion table and by the clergy and singers officiating at the
chief services; it thus includes presbytery, chancel proper and
choir (<i>q.v.</i>), and in this sense, in the case of cathedrals and
other large churches, is often used synonymously with choir.
In this more inclusive sense the early basilican churches had no
chancels, which were a comparatively late development; the
<i>cancelli</i>, <i>e.g.</i> of such a church as San Clemente at Rome are
equivalent not to the &ldquo;chancel screen&rdquo; of a medieval church
but to the &ldquo;altar rails&rdquo; that divide off the sanctuary. In
churches of the type that grew to its perfection in the middle
ages the chancels are clearly differentiated from the nave by
structural features: by the raising of the floor level, by the
presence of a &ldquo;chancel arch,&rdquo; and by a chancel or rood screen
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Rood</a></span>). The chancel screen might be no more than a low
barrier, some 4 ft. high, or a light structure of wood or wrought
iron; sometimes, however, they were massive stone screens,
which in certain cases were continued on either side between the
piers of the choir and (on the European continent) round the
east end of the sanctuary, as in the cathedrals of Paris, Bourges,
Limoges, Amiens and Chartres. These screens served the
purpose, in collegiate and conventual churches, of cutting off
the space reserved for the services conducted for and by the
members of the chapter or community. For popular services a
second high altar was usually set up to the west of the screen,
as formerly at Westminster Abbey. In parish churches the
screen was set, partly to differentiate the space occupied by the
clergy from that reserved for the laity, partly to support the
representation of the crucifixion known as the Rood. In these
churches, too, the chancel is very usually structurally differentiated
by being narrower and, sometimes, less high than the nave.</p>

<p>In the Church of England, the duty of repairing the chancel
falls upon the parson by custom, while the repair of the body
of the church falls on the parishioners. In particular cases,
as in certain London churches, the parishioners also have to
repair the chancel. Where there are both a rector and a vicar
the repairs are shared between them, and this is also the case
where the rector is a lay impropriator. By the rubric of the
English Prayer Book &ldquo;the chancels shall remain as they have
done in times past,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> distinguished from the body of the
church by some partition sufficient to separate the two without
interfering with the view of the congregation. At the Reformation,
and for some time after, this distinction was regarded by
the dominant Puritan party as a mark of sacerdotalism, and
services were commonly said in other parts of the church, the
chancels being closed and disused. The rubric, however, directs
that &ldquo;&rsquo;Morning and Evening Prayer&rsquo; shall be used in the
accustomed place in the church, chapel or chancel, except it
shall be otherwise determined by the Ordinary.&rdquo; Chancel screens,
with or without gates, are lawful, but chancellors of dioceses
have refused to grant a faculty to erect gates, as unnecessary or
inexpedient.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHANCELLOR<a name="ar147" id="ar147"></a></span> (M. Eng. and Anglo-Fr. <i>canceler</i>, <i>chanceler</i>, Fr.
<i>chancelier</i>, Lat. <i>cancellarius</i>), an official title used by most of the
peoples whose civilization has arisen directly or indirectly out of
the Roman empire. At different times and in different countries
it has stood and stands for very various duties, and has been, and
is, borne by officers of various degrees of dignity. The original
chancellors were the <i>cancelarii</i> of Roman courts of justice,
ushers who sat at the <i>cancelli</i> or lattice work screens of a
&ldquo;basilica&rdquo; or law court, which separated the judge and counsel
from the audience (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Chancel</a></span>). In the later Eastern empire
the <i>cancellarii</i> were promoted at first to notarial duties. The
barbarian kingdoms which arose on the ruin of the empire in the
West copied more or less intelligently the Roman model in all
their judicial and financial administration. Under the Frankish
kings of the Merovingian dynasty the <i>cancellarii</i> were subordinates
of the great officer of state called the <i>referendarius</i>,
who was the predecessor of the more modern chancellor. The
office became established under the form <i>archi-cancellarius</i>, or
chief of the <i>cancellarii</i>. Stubbs says that the Carolingian
chancellor was the royal notary and the arch-chancellor keeper
of the royal seal. His functions would naturally be discharged
by a cleric in times when book learning was mainly confined to
the clergy. From the reign of Louis the Pious the post was held
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page833" id="page833"></a>833</span>
by a bishop. By an equally natural process he became the chief
secretary of the king and of the queen, who also had her chancellor.
Such an office possessed an obvious capacity for developing on
the judicial as well as the administrative side. Appeals and
petitions of aggrieved persons would pass through the chancellor&rsquo;s
hands, as well as the political correspondence of the king. Nor
was the king the only man who had need of a chancellor. Great
officers and corporations also had occasion to employ an agent to
do secretarial, notarial and judicial work for them, and called
him by the convenient name of chancellor. The history of the
office in its many adaptations to public and private service is the
history of its development on judicial, administrative, political,
secretarial and notarial lines.</p>

<p>The model of the Carolingian court was followed by the
medieval states of Western Europe. In England the office of
chancellor dates back to the reign of Edward the Confessor,
the first English king to use the Norman practice
<span class="sidenote">The chancellor in England.</span>
of sealing instead of signing documents; and from the
Norman Conquest onwards the succession of chancellors
is continuous. The chancellor was originally, and long continued
to be, an ecclesiastic, who combined the functions of the most
dignified of the royal chaplains, the king&rsquo;s secretary in secular
matters, and keeper of the royal seal. From the first, then,
though at the outset overshadowed by that of the justiciar, the
office of chancellor was one of great influence and importance.
As chaplain the chancellor was keeper of the king&rsquo;s conscience;
as secretary he enjoyed the royal confidence in secular affairs;
as keeper of the seal he was necessary to all formal expressions
of the royal will. By him and his staff of chaplains the whole
secretarial work of the royal household was conducted, the
accounts were kept under the justiciar and treasurer, writs were
drawn up and sealed, and the royal correspondence was carried on.
He was, in fact, as Stubbs puts it, a sort of secretary of state for
all departments. &ldquo;This is he,&rdquo; wrote John of Salisbury (d. 1180),
&ldquo;who cancels (<i>cancellat</i>) the evil laws of the realm, and
makes equitable (<i>aequa</i>) the commands of a pious prince,&rdquo; a
curious anticipation of the chancellor&rsquo;s later equitable jurisdiction.
Under Henry II., indeed, the chancellor was already
largely employed in judicial work, either in attendance on the
king or in provincial visitations; though the peculiar jurisdiction
of the chancery was of later growth. By this time, however,
the chancellor was &ldquo;great alike in Curia and Exchequer&rdquo;; he
was <i>secundus a rege</i>, <i>i.e.</i> took precedence immediately after the
justiciar, and nothing was done either in the Curia or the exchequer
without his consent. So great was his office that William
FitzStephen, the biographer of Becket, tells us that it was not
purchasable (<i>emenda non est</i>), a statement which requires modification,
since it was in fact more than once sold under Henry I.,
Stephen, Richard and John (Stubbs, <i>Const. Hist.</i> i. pp. 384-497;
Gneist, <i>Const. Hist. of England</i>, p. 219), an evil precedent which
was, however, not long followed.</p>

<p>The judicial duties of the chancellor grew out of the fact that
all petitions addressed to the king passed through his hands.
The number and variety of these became so great that in 1280,
under Edward I., an ordinance was issued directing the chancellor
and the justices to deal with the greater number of them; those
which involved the use of the great seal being specially referred
to the chancellor. The chancellor and justices were to determine
which of them were &ldquo;so great, and of grace, that the chancellor
and others would not despatch them without the king,&rdquo; and these
the chancellor and other chief ministers were to carry in person to
the king (Stubbs ii. 263, note, and p. 268). At this period the
chancellor, though employed in equity, had ministerial functions
only; but when, in the reign of Edward III., the chancellor
ceased to follow the court, his tribunal acquired a more definite
character, and petitions for grace and favour began to be addressed
primarily to him, instead of being merely examined and
passed on by him to the king; and in the twenty-second year of
this reign matters which were of grace were definitely committed
to the chancellor for decision. This is the starting-point of
the equitable jurisdiction of the chancellor, whence developed
that immense body of rules, supplementing the deficiencies or
modifying the harshness of the common law, which is known
as Equity (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p>The position of the chancellor as speaker or prolocutor of the
House of Lords dates from the time when the ministers of the
royal Curia formed <i>ex officio</i> a part of the <i>commune
concilium</i> and parliament. The chancellor originally
<span class="sidenote">The chancellor in parliament.</span>
attended with the other officials, and he continued to
attend <i>ex officio</i> after they had ceased to do so. If he
chanced to be a bishop, he was summoned regularly <i>qua</i> bishop;
otherwise he attended without summons. When not a peer the
chancellor had no place in parliament except as chancellor, and
the act of 31 Henry VIII. cap. 10 (1539) laid down that, if not
a peer, he had &ldquo;no interest to give any assent or dissent in
the House.&rdquo; Yet Sir Robert Bourchier (d. 1349), the first lay
chancellor, had protested in 1341 against the first statute of 15
Edward III. (on trial by peers, &amp;c.), on the ground that it had not
received his assent and was contrary to the laws of the realm.
From the time, however, of William, Lord Cowper (first lord
high chancellor of Great Britain in 1705, created Baron Cowper
in 1706), all chancellors have been made peers on their elevation
to the woolsack. Sometimes the custody of the great seal has
been transferred from the chancellor to a special official, the lord
keeper of the great seal (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lord Keeper</a></span>); this was notably
the case under Queen Elizabeth (cf. the French <i>garde des sceaux</i>,
below). Sometimes it is put into commission, being affixed by
lords commissioners of the great seal. By the Catholic Emancipation
Act of 1829 it was enacted that none of these offices could
be held by a Roman Catholic (see further under <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lord High
Chancellor</a></span>). The office of lord chancellor of Ireland, and that
of chancellor of Scotland (who ceased to be appointed after the
Act of Union of 1707) followed the same lines of development.</p>

<p>The title of chancellor, without the predicates &ldquo;high&rdquo; or
&ldquo;lord,&rdquo; is also applied in the United Kingdom to a number of
other officials and functionaries of varying rank and
importance.    Of  these  the  most  important  is  the
<span class="sidenote">Chancellor of the exchequer.</span>
chancellor of the exchequer, an office which originated
in the separation of the chancery from the exchequer
in the reign of Henry III. (1216-1272). His duties consisted
originally in the custody and employment of the seal of the
exchequer, in the keeping of a counter-roll to check the roll kept
by the treasurer, and in the discharge of certain judicial functions
in the exchequer of account. So long as the treasury board was
in active working, the chancellorship of the exchequer was an
office of small importance, and even during a great part of the
19th century was not necessarily a cabinet office, unless held in
conjunction with that of first lord of the treasury. At the present
time the chancellor of the exchequer is minister of finance, and
therefore always of cabinet rank (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Exchequer</a></span>).</p>

<p>The chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster is the representative
of the crown in the management of its lands and the control
of its courts in the duchy of Lancaster, the property
of which is scattered over several counties.    These
<span class="sidenote">Chancellor of the duchy.</span>
lands and privileges, though their inheritance has
always been vested in the king and his heirs, have
always been kept distinct from the hereditary revenues of the
sovereign, whose palatine rights as duke of Lancaster were
distinct from his rights as king. The Judicature Act of 1873 left
only the chancery court of the duchy, but the chancellor can
appoint and dismiss the county court judges within the limits
of the duchy; he is responsible also for the land revenues of
the duchy, which are the private property of the sovereign,
and keeps the seal of the duchy. His appointment is by letters
patent, and his salary is derived from the revenue of the duchy.
As the judicial and estate work is done by subordinate officials,
the office is practically a sinecure and is usually given to a minister
whose assistance is necessary to a government, but who for one
reason or another cannot undertake the duties of an important
department. John Bright described him as the maid-of-all-work
of the cabinet.</p>

<p>The chancellor of a diocese is the official who presides over
the bishop&rsquo;s court and exercises jurisdiction in his name.
This use of the word is comparatively modern, and, though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page834" id="page834"></a>834</span>
employed in acts of parliament, is not mentioned in the commission,
<span class="sidenote">Ecclesiastical chancellors.</span>
having apparently been adopted on the analogy of the
like title in the state. The chancellor was originally
the keeper of the archbishop or bishop&rsquo;s seals; but
the office, as now understood, includes two other
offices distinguished in the commission by the titles
of vicar-general and official principal (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ecclesiastical
Jurisdiction</a></span>). The chancellor of a diocese must be distinguished
from the chancellor of a cathedral, whose office is the
same as that of the ancient <i>scholasticus</i> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Cathedral</a></span>).</p>

<p>The chancellor of an order of knighthood discharges notarial
duties and keeps the seal. The chancellor of a university is
an official of medieval origin. The appointment was
originally made by the popes, and the office from the
<span class="sidenote">Academic, &amp;c.</span>
first was one of great dignity and originally of great
power. The chancellor was, as he remains, the head of the
university; he had the general superintendence of its studies
and of its discipline, could make and unmake laws, try and
punish offences, appoint to professorial chairs and admit students
to the various degrees (see Du Cange, s. &ldquo;<i>Cancellarii Academiarum</i>&rdquo;).
In England the chancellorship of the universities
is now a more or less ornamental office and is conferred on noblemen
or statesmen of distinction, whose principal function is to
look after the general interests of the university, especially
in its relations with the government. The chancellor is represented
in the university by a vice-chancellor, who performs the
administrative and judicial functions of the office. In the United
States the heads of certain educational establishments have
the title of chancellor. In Scotland the foreman of a jury is
called its chancellor. In the United States the chancellors are
judges of the chancery courts of the states, <i>e.g.</i> Delaware and
New Jersey, where these courts are still maintained as distinct
from the courts of common law. In other states, <i>e.g.</i> New York
since 1847, the title has been abolished, and there is no federal
chancellor.</p>

<p>In diplomacy generally the chancellor of an embassy or
legation is an official attached to the suite of an ambassador or
minister. He performs the functions of a secretary, archivist,
notary and the like, and is at the head of the chancery, or
chancellery (Fr. <i>chancellerie</i>), of the mission. The functions
of this office are the transcribing and registering of official
despatches and other documents, and generally the transaction
of all the minor business, <i>e.g.</i> marriages, passports and the like,
connected with the duties of a diplomatic agent towards his
nationals in a foreign country. The dignified connotation of the
title chancellor has given to this office a prestige which in itself
it does not deserve; and &ldquo;chancery&rdquo; or &ldquo;chancellery&rdquo; is
commonly used as though it were synonymous with embassy,
while diplomatic style is sometimes called <i>style de chancellerie</i>,
though as a matter of fact the chanceries have nothing to do
with it.</p>

<p><i>France.</i>&mdash;The country in which the office of chancellor followed
most closely the same lines as in England is France. He had
become a great officer under the Carolingians, and he grew still
greater under the Capetian sovereigns. The great chancellor,
<i>summus cancellarius</i> or <i>archi-cancellarius</i>, was a dignitary who
had indeed little real power. The post was commonly filled by
the archbishop of Reims, or the bishop of Paris. The <i>cancellarius</i>,
who formed part of the royal court and administration, was
officially known as the <i>sub-cancellarius</i> in relation to the <i>summus
cancellarius</i>, but as <i>proto-cancellarius</i> in regard to his subordinate
<i>cancellarii</i>. He was a very great officer, an ecclesiastic who was
the chief of the king&rsquo;s chaplains or king&rsquo;s clerks, who administered
all ecclesiastical affairs; he had judicial powers, and from the
12th century had the general control of foreign affairs. The
chancellor in fact became so great that the Capetian kings, who
did not forget the mayor of the palace, grew afraid of him.
Few of the early ecclesiastical chancellors failed to come into
collision with the king, or parted with him on good terms.
Philip Augustus suspended the chancellorship throughout the
whole of his reign, and appointed a keeper of the seals (<i>garde
des sceaux</i>). The office was revived under Louis VIII., but the
ecclesiastical chancellorship was finally suppressed in 1227.
The king of the 13th century employed only keepers of the seal.
Under the reign of Philip IV. le Bel lay chancellors were first
appointed. From the reign of Charles V. to that of Louis XI. the
French <i>chancelier</i> was elected by the royal council. In the 16th
century he became irremovable, a distinction more honourable
than effective, for though the king could not dismiss him from
office he could, and on some occasions did, deprive him of the
right to exercise his functions, and entrusted them to a keeper of
the seal. The <i>chancelier</i> from the 13th century downwards was
the head of the law, and performed the duties which are now
entrusted to the minister of justice. His office was abolished
when in 1790 the whole judicial system of France was swept
away by the Revolution. The smaller <i>chanceliers</i> of the provincial
parlements and royal courts disappeared at the same time. But
when Napoleon was organizing the empire he created an arch-chancellor,
an office which was imitated rather from the <i>Erz-Kanzler</i>
of the Holy Roman Empire than from the old French
<i>chancelier</i>. At the Restoration the office of chancellor of France
was restored, the chancellor being president of the House of
Peers, but it was finally abolished at the revolution of 1848.
The administration of the Legion of Honour is presided over by
a <i>grand chancelier</i>, who is a grand cross of the order, and who
advises the head of the state in matters concerning the affairs
of the order. The title of <i>chancelier</i> continues also to be used
in France for the large class of officials who discharge notarial
duties in some public offices, in embassies and consulates. They
draw up diplomas and prepare all formal documents, and have
charge of the registration and preservation of the archives.</p>

<p><i>Spain.</i>&mdash;In Spain the office of chancellor, <i>canciller</i>, was introduced
by Alphonso VII. (1126-1157), who adopted it from the
court of his cousins of the Capetian dynasty of France. The
<i>canciller</i> did not in Spain go beyond being the king&rsquo;s notary.
The chancellor of the privy seal, <i>canciller del sello de la puridad</i>
(literally the secret seal), was the king&rsquo;s secretary, and sealed
all papers other than diplomas and charters. The office was
abolished in 1496, and its functions were transferred to the royal
secretaries. The <i>cancelario</i> was the chancellor of a university.
The <i>canciller</i> succeeded the <i>maesescuela</i> or <i>scholasticus</i> of a church
or monastery. <i>Canciller mayor de Castilla</i> is an honorary title
of the archbishops of Toledo. The <i>gran canciller de las Indias</i>,
high chancellor of the Indies, held the seal used for the American
dominions of Spain, and presided at the council in the absence
of the president. The office disappeared with the loss of Spain&rsquo;s
empire in America.</p>

<p><i>Italy, Germany, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;In central and northern Europe, and in
Italy, the office had different fortunes. In southern Italy, where
Naples and Sicily were feudally organized, the chancellors of
the Norman kings, who followed Anglo-Norman precedents very
closely, and, at least in Sicily, employed Englishmen, were such
officers as were known in the West. The similarity is somewhat
concealed by the fact that these sovereigns also adopted names
and offices from the imperial court at Constantinople. Their
chancellor was officially known as Protonotary and Logothete,
and their example was followed by the German princes of the
Hohenstaufen family, who acquired the kingdoms of Naples and
Sicily. The papal or apostolic chancery is dealt with in the
article on the Curia Romana (<i>q.v.</i>). It may be pointed out here,
however, that the close connexion of the papacy with the Holy
Roman Empire is illustrated by the fact that the archbishop
of Cologne, who by right of his see was the emperor&rsquo;s arch-chancellor
(<i>Erz-Kanzler</i>) for Italy, was confirmed as papal arch-chancellor
by a bull of Leo IX. in 1052. The origin and duration
of this connexion are, however, obscure; it appears to have
ceased before 1187. The last record of a papal chancellor in
the middle ages dates from 1212, from which time onward, for
reasons much disputed, the head of the papal chancery bore
the title vice-chancellor (Hinschius i. 439), until the office of
chancellor was restored by the constitution <i>Sapientius</i> of Pius X.
in 1908.</p>

<p>The title of arch-chancellor (<i>Erz-Kanzler</i>) was borne by three
great ecclesiastical dignitaries of the Holy Roman Empire.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page835" id="page835"></a>835</span>
The archbishop of Mainz was arch-chancellor for Germany.
The archbishop of Cologne held the dignity for Italy, and the
archbishop of Trier for Gaul and the kingdom of Arles. The
second and third of these dignities became purely formal with
the decline of the Empire in the 13th century. But the arch-chancellorship
of Germany remained to some extent a reality
till the Empire was finally dissolved in 1806. The office continued
to be attached to the archbishopric of Mainz, which was an
electorate. Karl von Dalberg, the last holder of the office, and
the first prince primate of the Confederation of the Rhine,
continued to act in show at least as chancellor of that body,
and was after a fashion the predecessor of the <i>Bundes Kanzler</i>,
or chancellor of the North German Confederation. The duties
imposed on the imperial chancery by the very complicated
constitution of the Empire were, however, discharged by a vice-chancellor
who was attached to the court of the emperor. The
abbot of Fulda was chancellor to the empress.</p>

<p>The house of Austria in their hereditary dominions, and in
those of their possessions which they treated as hereditary,
even where the sovereignty was in theory elective, made a large
and peculiar use of the title chancellor. The officers so called
were of course distinct from the arch-chancellor and vice-chancellor
of the Empire, although the imperial crown became
in practice hereditary in the house of Habsburg. In the family
states their administration was, to use a phrase familiar to the
French, &ldquo;polysynodic.&rdquo; As it was when fully developed, and
as it remained until the March revolution of 1848, it was
conducted through boards presided over by a chancellor. There
were three aulic chancellorships for the internal affairs of their
dominions, &ldquo;a united aulic chancellorship for all parts of the
empire (<i>i.e.</i> of Austria, not the Holy Roman) not belonging to
Hungary or Transylvania, and a separate chancellorship for
each of those last-mentioned provinces&rdquo; (Hartig, <i>Genesis of
the Revolution in Austria</i>). There were also a house, a court, and
a state chancellor for the business of the imperial household
and foreign affairs, who were not, however, the presidents of a
board. These &ldquo;aulic&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i> court) officers were in fact secretaries
of the sovereign, and administrative or political rather than
judicial in character, though the boards over which they presided
controlled judicial as well as administrative affairs. In the case of
such statesmen as Kaunitz and Metternich, who were house,
court, and state chancellors as well as &ldquo;united aulic&rdquo; chancellors,
the combination of offices made them in practice prime ministers,
or rather lieutenants-general, of the sovereign. The system
was subject to modifications, and in the end it broke down
under its own complications. We are not dealing here with
the confusing history of the Austrian administration, and these
details are only quoted to show how it happened that in Austria
the title chancellor came to mean a political officer and minister.
There is obviously a vast difference between such an official
as Kaunitz, who as house, court, and state chancellor was
minister of foreign affairs, and as &ldquo;united aulic&rdquo; chancellor had a
general superiority over the whole machinery of government, and
the lord high chancellor in England, the <i>chancelier</i> in France, or
the <i>canciller mayor</i> in Castile, though the title was the same. The
development of the office in Austria must be understood in order
to explain the position and functions of the imperial chancellor
(<i>Reichs Kanzler</i>) of the modern German empire. Although the
present empire is sometimes rhetorically and absurdly spoken of
as a revival of the medieval Empire, it is in reality an adaptation
of the Austrian empire, which was a continuation under a new
name of the hereditary Habsburg monarchy. The <i>Reichs Kanzler</i>
is the immediate successor of the <i>Bundes Kanzler</i>, or chancellor
of the North German Confederation (<i>Bund</i>). But the <i>Bundes
Kanzler</i>, who bore no sort of resemblance except in mere
name to the <i>Erz-Kanzler</i> of the old Empire, was in a position
not perhaps actually like that of Prince Kaunitz, but capable of
becoming much the same thing. When the German empire was
established in 1871 Prince Bismarck, who was <i>Bundes Kanzler</i>
and became <i>Reichs Kanzler</i>, took care that his position should
be as like as possible to that of Prince Kaunitz or Prince Metternich.
The constitution of the German empire is separately
dealt with, but it may be pointed out here that the <i>Reichs
Kanzler</i> is the federal minister of the empire, the chief of the
federal officials, and a great political officer, who directs the
foreign affairs, and superintends the internal affairs, of the
empire.</p>

<p>In these German states the title of chancellor is also given as
in France to government and diplomatic officials who do notarial
duties and have charge of archives. The title of chancellor has
naturally been widely used in the German and Scandinavian
states, and in Russia since the reign of Peter the Great. It has
there as elsewhere wavered between being a political and a
judicial office. Frederick the Great of Prussia created a <i>Gross
Kanzler</i> for judicial duties in 1746. But there was in Prussia
a state chancellorship on the Austrian model. It was allowed
to lapse on the death of Hardenberg in 1822. The Prussian
chancellor after his time was one of the four court ministries
(<i>Hofämter</i>) of the Prussian monarchy.</p>

of a mixed character, an old term in English law for a form of
homicide arising out of a sudden affray or quarrel. The homicide
has not the characteristic of &ldquo;malice prepense&rdquo; which would
raise the death to murder, nor the completely accidental nature
which would reduce it to homicide by misadventure. It was
practically identical, therefore, with manslaughter.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHANCERY,<a name="ar150" id="ar150"></a></span> in English law, the court of the lord chancellor
of England, consolidated in 1873 along with the other superior
courts in the Supreme Court of Judicature. Its origin is noticed
under the head of Chancellor.</p>

<p>It has been customary to say that the court of chancery
consists of two distinct tribunals&mdash;one a court of common law,
the other a court of equity. From the former have issued all
the original writs passing under the great seal, all commissions
of sewers, lunacy, and the like&mdash;some of these writs being originally
kept in a <i>hanaper</i> or hamper (whence the &ldquo;hanaper office&rdquo;),
and others in a little sack or bag (whence the &ldquo;petty-bag office&rdquo;).
The court had likewise power to hold pleas upon <i>scire facias</i> (<i>q.v.</i>)
for repeal of letters patent, &amp;c. &ldquo;So little,&rdquo; says Blackstone,
&ldquo;is commonly done on the common law side of the court that
I have met with no traces of any writ of error being actually
brought since the fourteenth year of Queen Elizabeth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The equitable jurisdiction of the court of chancery was
founded on the supposed superiority of conscience and equity
over the strict law. The appearance of equity in England is in
harmony with the general course of legal history in progressive
societies. What is remarkable is that, instead of being incorporated
with or superseding the common law, it gave rise to a
wholly independent set of tribunals. The English dislike of the
civil law, and the tendency to follow precedent which has never
ceased to characterize English lawyers, account for this unfortunate
separation. The claims of equity in its earlier stages
are well expressed in the little treatise called <i>Doctor and Student</i>,
published in the reign of Henry VIII.:&mdash;&ldquo;Conscience never
resisteth the law nor addeth to it, but only when the law is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page836" id="page836"></a>836</span>
directly in itself against the <i>law of God</i>, or <i>law of reason</i>.&rdquo;  So also
King James, speaking in the Star Chamber, says: &ldquo;Where the
rigour of the law in many cases will undo a subject, then the
chancery tempers the law with equity, and so mixes mercy with
justice, as it preserves a man from destruction.&rdquo; This theory
of the essential opposition between law and equity, and of the
natural superiority of the latter, remained long after equity had
ceased to found itself on natural justice, and had become as
fixed and rigid as the common law itself. The jealousy of the
common lawyers came to a head in the time of Lord Ellesmere,
when Coke disputed the right of the chancery to give relief
against a judgment of the court of queen&rsquo;s bench obtained
by gross fraud and imposition. James I., after consultation,
decided in favour of the court of equity. The substitution of
lay for clerical chancellors is regarded by G. Spence (<i>Equitable
Jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery</i>, 2 vols., 1846-1849) as having
at first been unfortunate, inasmuch as the laymen were ignorant
of the principles on which their predecessors had acted. Lord
Nottingham (1621-1682) is usually credited with the first attempt
to reduce the decisions of the court to order, and his work was
continued by Lord Hardwicke (1690-1764). By the time of
Lord Eldon equity had become fixed, and the judges, like their
brethren in the common law courts, strictly followed the precedents.
Henceforward chancery and common law courts have
exhibited the anomaly of two co-ordinate sets of tribunals,
empowered to deal with the same matters, and compelled to
proceed in many cases on wholly different principles. The court
of chancery could in most cases prevent a person from taking
advantage of a common law right, not approved of by its own
system. But if a suitor chose to go to a court of common law,
he might claim such unjust rights, and it required the special
intervention of the court of equity to prevent his enforcing them.
In many cases also a special application had to be made to
chancery for facilities which were absolutely necessary to the
successful conduct of a case at common law. Another source of
difficulty and annoyance was the uncertainty in many cases
whether the chancery or common law courts were the proper
tribunal, so that a suitor often found at the close of an expensive
and protracted suit that he had mistaken his court and must go
elsewhere for relief. Attempts more or less successful were made to
lessen those evils by giving the powers to both sets of courts; but
down to the consolidation effected by the Judicature Act, the
English judicial system justified the sarcasm of Lord Westbury,
that one tribunal was set up to do injustice and another to stop it.</p>

<p>The equitable jurisdiction of chancery was commonly divided
into <i>exclusive</i>, <i>concurrent</i> and <i>auxiliary</i>. Chancery had exclusive
jurisdiction when there were no forms of action by which relief
could be obtained at law, in respect of rights which ought to be
enforced. Trusts were the most conspicuous example of this
class. It also included the rights of married women, infants
and lunatics. Chancery had concurrent jurisdiction when the
common law did not give <i>adequate</i> relief, <i>e.g.</i> in cases of fraud,
accident, mistake, specific performance of contracts, &amp;c. It had
auxiliary jurisdiction when the administrative machinery of the
law courts was unable to procure the necessary evidence.</p>

<p>The Judicature Act 1873 enacted (§ 24) that in every civil
cause or matter commenced in the High Court of Justice, law
and equity should be administered by the High Court of Justice
and the court of appeal respectively, according to the rules therein
contained, which provide for giving effect in all cases to &ldquo;equitable
rights and other matters of equity.&rdquo; The 25th section
declared the law hereafter to be administered in England on
certain points, and ordained that &ldquo;generally in all matters not
hereinbefore particularly mentioned in which there is any conflict
or variance between the rules of equity and the rules of
the common law with reference to the same matter, the rules
of equity shall prevail.&rdquo; The 34th section specifically assigned
to the chancery division the following causes and matters:&mdash;The
administration of the estates of deceased persons; the
dissolution of partnerships, or the taking of partnership, or
other accounts; the redemption or foreclosure of mortgages;
the raising of portions, or other charges on land; the sale
and distribution of the proceeds of property subject to any
lien or charge; the execution of trusts, charitable or private;
the rectification, or setting aside, or cancellation of deeds or
other written instruments; the specific performance of contracts
between vendors and purchasers of real estates, including contracts
for leases; the partition or sale of real estates; the wardship
of infants and the care of infants&rsquo; estates.</p>

<p>The chancery division originally consisted of the lord chancellor
as president and the master of the rolls, and the three vice-chancellors.
The master of the rolls was also a member of the
court of appeal, but Sir George Jessel, who held that office when
the new system came into force, regularly sat as a judge of
first instance until 1881, when, by the act of that year (sec. 2),
the master of the rolls became a member of the court of appeal
only, and provision was made for the appointment of a judge
to supply the vacancy thus occasioned (sec. 3). Sir James Bacon
(1798-1895) was the last survivor of the vice-chancellors. He
retained his seat on the bench until the year 1886, when he
retired after more than seventeen years&rsquo; judicial service. For
some reason the solicitors, when they had the choice, preferred
to bring their actions in the chancery division. The practice
introduced by the Judicature Act of trying actions with oral
evidence instead of affidavits, and the comparative inexperience
of the chancery judges and counsel in that mode of trial, tended
to lengthen the time required for the disposal of the business.
Demand was consequently made for more judges in the chancery
division. By an act of 1877 the appointment of an additional
judge in that division was authorized, and Sir Edward Fry
(afterwards better known as a lord justice) was appointed.
In August 1899 the crown consented to the appointment of a
new judge of the High Court in the chancery division on an
address from both Houses of Parliament, pursuant to the 87th
section of the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876. The chancery
division, therefore, consists of the lord chancellor and six puisne
judges. The latter are styled and addressed in the same manner
as was customary in the old common law courts.<a name="fa1e" id="fa1e" href="#ft1e"><span class="sp">1</span></a>  Formerly
there were only four judges of this division (being the successors
of the master of the rolls and the three vice-chancellors) to whom
chambers were attached. The fifth judge heard only causes
with witnesses transferred to him from the overflowing of the
lists of his four brethren. In each set of chambers there were
three chief clerks, with a staff of assistant clerks under them.
The chief clerks had no original jurisdiction, but heard applications
only on behalf of the judge to whose chambers they belonged,
and theoretically every suitor had the right to have his application
heard by the judge himself in chambers. But the appointment
of a sixth judge enabled the lord chancellor to carry out
a reform recommended by a departmental committee which
reported in 1885. The great difficulty in the chancery division
always was to secure the continuous hearing of actions with
witnesses, as nearly one-half of the judge&rsquo;s time was taken up
with cases adjourned to him from chambers and other administrative
business and non-witness actions and motions. The interruption
of a witness action for two or three days, particularly
in a country case, occasioned great expense, and had other
inconveniences. It was a simple remedy to link the judges in
pairs with one list of causes and one set of chambers assigned to
each pair. This reform was effected by the alteration of a few
words in certain rules of court. There are therefore, only three
sets of chambers, each containing four chief clerks, or, as they
are now styled, masters of the Supreme Court, and one of the
linked judges, by arrangement between themselves, continuously
tries the witness actions in their common list, while the other
attends in chambers, and also hears the motions, petitions,
adjourned summonses and non-witness cases.</p>

<p>Although styled masters it does not appear that the chief
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page837" id="page837"></a>837</span>
clerks have any larger or different jurisdiction than they had
before. They are still the representatives of and responsible
to the judges to whom the chambers are attached. The judge
may either hear an application in chambers, or may direct any
matter which he thinks of sufficient importance to be argued
before him in court, or a party may move in court to discharge
an order made in chambers with a view to an appeal, but this is
not required if the judge certifies that the matter was sufficiently
discussed before him in chambers.</p>

<p>Under the existing rules of court many orders can now be
made on summons in chambers which used formerly to require
a suit or petition in court (see Order LV. as to foreclosure,
administration, payment out of money in court and generally).
The judge is also enabled to decide any particular question arising
in the administration of the estate of a deceased person or execution
of the trusts of a settlement without directing administration
of the whole estate or execution of the trusts generally by the
court (Order LV. rule 10), and where an application for accounts
is made by a dissatisfied beneficiary or creditor to order the
accounts to be delivered out of court, and the application to
stand over till it can be seen what questions (if any) arise upon
the accounts requiring the intervention of the court (Order LV.
2, 10a). Delay and consequent worry and expense are thus
saved to the parties, and, at the same time, a great deal of routine
administration is got rid of and a larger portion of the judicial
term can be devoted to hearing actions and deciding any question
of importance in court. The work of the chambers staff of the
judges has probably been increased; but, on the other hand,
it has been lightened by the removal of the winding-up business.
The chancery division has also inherited from the court of
chancery a staff of registrars and taxing masters.</p>

<p>In the United States &ldquo;chancery&rdquo; is generally used as the
synonym of &ldquo;equity.&rdquo; Chancery practice is practice in cases
of equity. Chancery courts are equity courts (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Equity</a></span>).

<p><span class="bold">CHANDA,<a name="ar151" id="ar151"></a></span> a town and district of British India, in the Nagpur
division of the Central Provinces. In 1901 the town had a
population of 17,803. It is situated at the junction of the Virai
and Jharpat rivers. It was the capital of the Gond kingdom
of Chanda, which was established on the ruins of a Hindu state
in the 11th or 12th century, and survived until 1751 (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Gondwana</a></span>).
The town is still surrounded by a stone wall 5½m. in
circuit. It has several old temples and tombs, and the district
at large is rich in remains of antiquity. There are manufactures
of cotton, silk, brass-ware and leather slippers, and a considerable
local trade.</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">District of Chanda</span> has an area of 10,156 sq. m. Excepting
in the extreme west, hills are thickly dotted over the country,
sometimes in detached ranges, occasionally in isolated peaks
rising sheer out from the plain. Towards the east they increase
in height, and form a broad tableland, at places 2000 ft. above
sea-level. The Wainganga river flows through the district from
north to south, meeting the Wardha river at Seoni, where their
streams unite to form the Pranhita. Chanda is thickly studded
with fine tanks, or rather artificial lakes, formed by closing the
outlets of small valleys, or by throwing a dam across tracts
intersected by streams. The broad clear sheets of water thus
created are often very picturesque in their surroundings of wood
and rock. The chief architectural objects of interest are the
cave temples at Bhandak, Winjbasani, Dewala and Ghugus;
a rock temple in the bed of the Wardha river below Ballalpur;
the ancient temples at Markandi, Ambgaon and elsewhere;
the forts of Wairagarh and Ballalpur; and the old walls of the
city of Chanda, its system of waterworks, and the tombs of the
Gond kings. In 1901 the population was 601,533, showing a
decrease of 15% in the decade. The principal crops are rice,
millet, pulse, wheat, oil-seeds and cotton. The district contains
the coalfield of Warora, which was worked by government till
1906, when it was closed. Other fields are known, and iron ores
also occur. The district suffered severely from famine in 1900,
when in April the number of persons relieved rose to 90,000.</p>

Lahore, but lived at the court of Prithwi Raja (Prithiraj), the
last Hindu sovereign of Delhi. His <i>Prithiraj Rasau</i>, a poem of
some 100,000 stanzas, chronicling his master&rsquo;s deeds and the
contemporary history of his part of India, is valuable not only
as historical material but as the earliest monument of the Western
Hindi language, and the first of the long series of bardic
chronicles for which Rajputana is celebrated. It is written in
ballad form, and portions of it are still sung by itinerant bards
throughout north-western India and Rajputana.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHANDELIER,<a name="ar154" id="ar154"></a></span> a frame of metal, wood, crystal, glass or china,
pendent from roof or ceiling for the purpose of holding lights.
The word is French, but the appliance has lost its original
significance of a candle-holder, the chandelier being now chiefly
used for gas and electric lighting. Clusters of hanging lights
were in use as early as the 14th century, and appear originally
to have been almost invariably of wood. They were, however,
so speedily ruined by grease that metal was gradually subsituted,
and fine and comparatively early examples in beaten
iron, brass, copper and even silver are still extant. Throughout
the 17th century the hanging candle-holder of brass or bronze
was common throughout northern Europe, as innumerable
pictures and engravings testify. In the great periods of the art
of decoration in France many magnificent chandeliers were
made by Boulle, and at a later date by Gouthière and Thomire
and others among the extraordinarily clever <i>fondeurs-ciseleurs</i>
of the second half of the 18th century. The chandelier in rock
crystal and its imitations had come in at least a hundred years
before their day, and continued in favour to the middle of the
19th century, or even somewhat later. It reached at last the
most extreme elaboration of banality, with ropes of pendants
and hanging faceted drops often called lustres. When many
lights were burning in one of these chandeliers an effect of
splendour was produced that was not out of place in a ballroom,
but the ordinary household varieties were extremely ugly and
inartistic. The more purely domestic chandelier usually carries
from two to six lights. The rapidly growing use of electricity
as an illuminating medium and the preference for smaller clusters
of lights have, however, pushed into the background an appliance
which had grown extremely commonplace in design, and
had become out of character with modern ideas of household
decoration.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHANDERNAGORE,<a name="ar155" id="ar155"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Chandarnagar</span>, a French settlement
in India, with a small adjoining territory, situated on the right
bank of the river Hugli, 20 m. above Calcutta, in 22° 51&prime; 40&Prime; N,
and 88° 24&prime; 50&Prime; E. Area 3 sq. m.; pop. (1901) 25,000. Chandernagore
has played an important part in the European history of
Bengal. It became a permanent French settlement, in 1688, but
did not rise to any importance till the time of Dupleix, during
whose administration more than two thousand brick houses were
erected in the town and a considerable maritime trade was carried
on. In 1757 Chandernagore was bombarded by an English fleet
under Admiral Watson and captured; the fortifications and
houses were afterwards demolished. On peace being established
the town was restored to the French in 1763. When hostilities
afterwards broke out in 1794, it was again taken possession of by
the English, and was held by them till 1816, when it was a second
time given up to the French; it has ever since remained in their
possession. All the former commercial grandeur of Chandernagore
has now passed away, and at present it is little more
than a quiet suburb of Calcutta, without any external trade. The
European town is situated at the bottom of a beautiful reach of
the Hugli, with clean wide thoroughfares, and many elegant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page838" id="page838"></a>838</span>
residences along the river-bank. The authorities of Chandernagore
are subject to the jurisdiction of the governor-general of
Pondicherry, to whom is confided the general government of
all the French possessions in India.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHANDLER, HENRY WILLIAM<a name="ar156" id="ar156"></a></span> (1828-1889), English scholar,
was born in London on the 31st of January 1828. In 1848 he
entered Pembroke College, Oxford, where he was elected fellow
in 1853. In 1867 he succeeded H.L. Mansel as Waynflete professor
of moral and metaphysical philosophy, and in 1884 was
appointed curator of the Bodleian library. He died by his own
hand in Oxford on the 16th of May 1889. He was chiefly known
as an Aristotelian scholar, and his knowledge of the Greek commentators
on Aristotle was profound. He collected a vast amount
of material for an edition of the fragments of his favourite author,
but on the appearance of Valentine Rose&rsquo;s work in 1886 he
abandoned the idea. Two works on the bibliography of Aristotle,
<i>A Catalogue of Editions of Aristotle&rsquo;s Nicomachean Ethics and of
Works illustrative of them printed in the 15th century</i> (1868), and
<i>A Chronological Index to Editions of Aristotle&rsquo;s Nicomachean
Ethics, and of Works illustrative of them from the Origin of Printing
to 1799</i> (1878), are of great value. Chandler&rsquo;s collection of works
on Aristotelian literature is now in the library of Pembroke
College. His <i>Practical Introduction to Greek Accentuation</i> (1862,
ed. min. 1877) is the standard work in English.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHANDLER, RICHARD<a name="ar157" id="ar157"></a></span> (1738-1810), British antiquary, was
born in 1738 at Elson in Hampshire, and educated at Winchester
and at Queen&rsquo;s and Magdalen Colleges, Oxford. His first work
consisted of fragments from the minor Greek poets, with notes
(<i>Elegiaca Graeca</i>, 1759); and in 1763 he published a fine edition
of the Arundelian marbles, <i>Marmora Oxoniensia</i>, with a Latin
translation, and a number of suggestions for supplying the lacunae.
He was sent by the Dilettanti Society with Nicholas Revett,
an architect, and Pars, a painter, to explore the antiquities of
Ionia and Greece (1763-1766); and the result of their work was
the two magnificent folios of Ionian antiquities published in 1769.
He subsequently held several church preferments, including the
rectory of Tylehurst, in Berkshire, where he died on the 9th of
February 1810. Other works by Chandler were <i>Inscriptiones
Antiquae pleraeque nondum editae</i> (Oxford, 1774); <i>Travels in
Asia Minor</i> (1775); <i>Travels in Greece</i> (1776); <i>History of Ilium</i>
(1803), in which he asserted the accuracy of Homer&rsquo;s geography.
His <i>Life of Bishop Waynflete</i>, lord high chancellor to Henry VI.,
appeared in 1811.</p>

<div class="condensed">

<p><span class="bold">CHANDLER, SAMUEL<a name="ar158" id="ar158"></a></span> (1693-1766), English Nonconformist
divine, was born in 1693 at Hungerford, in Berkshire, where his
father was a minister. He was sent to school at Gloucester,
where he began a lifelong friendship with Bishop Butler and
Archbishop Secker; and he afterwards studied at Leiden. His
talents and learning were such that he was elected fellow of the
Royal and Antiquarian Societies, and was made D.D. of Edinburgh
and Glasgow. He also received offers of high preferment in
the Church of England. These he refused, remaining to the end
of his life in the position of a Presbyterian minister. He was
moderately Calvinistic in his views and leaned towards Arianism.
He took a leading part in the deist controversies of the time, and
discussed with some of the bishops the possibility of an act of
comprehension. From 1716 to 1726 he preached at Peckham, and
for forty years he was pastor of a meeting-house in Old Jewry.
During two or three years, having fallen into pecuniary distress
through the failure of the South Sea scheme, he kept a book-shop
in the Poultry. On the death of George II. in 1760 Chandler
published a sermon in which he compared that king to King David.
This view was attacked in a pamphlet entitled <i>The History of the
Man after God&rsquo;s own Heart</i>, in which the author complained of the
parallel as an insult to the late king, and, following Pierre Bayle,
exhibited King David as an example of perfidy, lust and cruelty.
Chandler condescended to reply first in a review of the tract
(1762) and then in <i>A Critical History of the Life of David</i>, which is
perhaps the best of his productions. This work was just completed
when he died, on the 8th of May 1766. He left 4 vols. of
sermons (1768), and a paraphrase of the Epistles to the Galatians
and Ephesians (1777), several works on the evidences of Christianity,
and various pamphlets against Roman Catholicism.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHANDLER, ZACHARIAH<a name="ar159" id="ar159"></a></span> (1813-1879), American politician,
was born at Bedford, New Hampshire, on the 10th of December
1813. In 1833 he removed to Detroit, Michigan, where he became
a prosperous dry-goods merchant. He took a prominent part as
a Whig in politics (serving as mayor in 1851), and, impelled by
his strong anti-slavery views, actively furthered the work of
the &ldquo;Underground Railroad,&rdquo; of which Detroit was one of the
principal &ldquo;transfer&rdquo; points. He was one of the organizers in
Michigan of the Republican party, and in 1857 succeeded Lewis
Cass in the United States Senate, serving until 1875, and at once
taking his stand with the most radical opponents of slavery
extension. When the Civil War became inevitable he endeavoured
to impress upon the North the necessity of taking extraordinary
measures for the preservation of the Union. After the fall of
Fort Sumter he advocated the enlistment of 500,000 instead of
75,000 men for a long instead of a short term, and the vigorous
enforcement of confiscation measures. In July 1862 he made a
bitter attack in the Senate on General George B. McClellan,
charging him with incompetency and lack of &ldquo;nerve.&rdquo; Throughout
the war he allied himself with the most radical of the Republican
faction in opposition to President Lincoln&rsquo;s policy, and
subsequently became one of the bitterest opponents of President
Johnson&rsquo;s plan of reconstruction. From October 1875 to March
1877 he was secretary of the interior in the cabinet of President
Grant, succeeding Columbus Delano (1809-1896). In 1876, as
chairman of the national republican committee, he managed
the campaign of Hayes against Tilden. In February 1879 he was
re-elected to the Senate to succeed Isaac P. Christiancy (1812-1890),
and soon afterwards, in a speech concerning Mexican
War pensions, bitterly denounced Jefferson Davis. He died at
Chicago, Illinois, on the 1st of November 1879. By his extraordinary
force of character he exercised a wide personal influence
during his lifetime, but failed to stamp his personality upon any
measure or policy of lasting importance.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHANDOS, BARONS AND DUKES OF.<a name="ar160" id="ar160"></a></span> The English title of
Chandos began as a barony in 1554, and was continued in the
family of Brydges (becoming a dukedom in 1719) till 1789. In
1822 the dukedom was revived in connexion with that of
Buckingham.</p>

<p><span class="sc">John Brydges</span>, 1st Baron Chandos (c. 1490-1557), a son of
Sir Giles Brydges, or Bruges (d. 1511), was a prominent figure
at the English court during the reigns of Henry VIII., Edward VI.
and Mary. He took part in suppressing the rebellion of Sir
Thomas Wyat in 1554, and as lieutenant of the Tower of London
during the earlier part of Mary&rsquo;s reign, had the custody, not only
of Lady Jane Grey and of Wyat, but for a short time of the
princess Elizabeth. He was created Baron Chandos of Sudeley
in 1554, one of his ancestors, Alice, being a grand-daughter of
Sir Thomas Chandos (d. 1375), and he died in March 1557. The
three succeeding barons, direct descendants of the 1st baron,
were all members of parliament and persons of some importance.
Grey, 5th Baron Chandos (c. 1580-1621), lord-lieutenant of
Gloucestershire, was called the &ldquo;king of the Cotswolds,&rdquo; owing
to his generosity and his magnificent style of living at his
residence, Sudeley Castle. He has been regarded by Horace
Walpole and others as the author of some essays, <i>Horae Subsecivae</i>.
His elder son George, 6th Baron Chandos (1620-1655),
was a supporter of Charles I. during his struggle with Parliament,
and distinguished himself at the first battle of Newbury in 1643.
He had six daughters but no sons, and after the death of his
brother William in 1676 the barony came to a kinsman, Sir
James Brydges, Bart. (1642-1714), who was English ambassador
to Constantinople from 1680 to 1685.</p>

<p><span class="sc">James Brydges</span>, 1st duke of Chandos (1673-1744), son and
heir of the last-named, had been member of parliament for
Hereford from 1698 to 1714, and, three days after his father&rsquo;s
death, was created Viscount Wilton and earl of Carnarvon.
For eight years, from 1705 to 1713, during the War of the Spanish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page839" id="page839"></a>839</span>
Succession, he was paymaster-general of the forces abroad,
and in this capacity he amassed great wealth. In 1719 he was
created marquess of Carnarvon and duke of Chandos. The duke
is chiefly remembered on account of his connexion with Handel
and with Pope. He built a magnificent house at Canons near
Edgware in Middlesex, and is said to have contemplated the
construction of a private road between this place and his unfinished
house in Cavendish Square, London. For over two
years Handel, employed by Chandos, lived at Canons, where
he composed his oratorio <i>Esther</i>. Pope, who in his <i>Moral Essays</i>
(<i>Epistle to the Earl of Burlington</i>) doubtless described Canons
under the guise of &ldquo;Timon&rsquo;s Villa,&rdquo; referred to the duke in the
line, &ldquo;Thus gracious Chandos is belov&rsquo;d at sight&rdquo;; but Swift,
less complimentary, called him &ldquo;a great complier with every
court.&rdquo; The poet was caricatured by Hogarth for his supposed
servility to the duke. Chandos, who was lord-lieutenant of the
counties of Hereford and Radnor, and chancellor of the university
of St Andrews, became involved in financial difficulties, and after
his death on the 9th of August 1744 Canons was pulled down.
He was succeeded by his son Henry, 2nd duke (1708-1771), and
grandson James, 3rd duke (1731-1789). On the death of the
latter without sons in September 1789 all his titles, except
that of Baron Kinloss, became extinct, although a claimant
arose for the barony of Chandos of Sudeley. The 3rd duke&rsquo;s only
daughter, Anna Elizabeth, who became Baroness Kinloss on
her father&rsquo;s death, was married in 1796 to Richard Grenville,
afterwards marquess of Buckingham; and in 1822 this nobleman
was created duke of Buckingham and Chandos (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Buckingham,

<p><span class="bold">CHANDRAGUPTA MAURYA<a name="ar162" id="ar162"></a></span> (reigned 321-296 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), known
to the Greeks as Sandracottus, founder of the Maurya empire
and first paramount ruler of India, was the son of a king of
Magadha by a woman of humble origin, whose caste he took,
and whose name, Mura, is said to have been the origin of that of
Maurya assumed by his dynasty. As a youth he was driven into
exile by his kinsman, the reigning king of Magadha. In the
course of his wanderings he met Alexander the Great, and,
according to Plutarch (<i>Alexander</i>, cap. 62), encouraged him to
invade the Ganges kingdom by enlarging on the extreme unpopularity
of the reigning monarch. During his exile he collected
a large force of the warlike clans of the north-west frontier, and
on the death of Alexander attacked the Macedonian garrisons
and conquered the Punjab. He next attacked Magadha, dethroned
and slew the king, his enemy, with every member of
his family, and established himself on the throne (321). The
great army acquired from his predecessor he increased until it
reached the total of 30,000 cavalry, 9000 elephants, and 600,000
infantry; and with this huge force he overran all northern India,
establishing his empire from the Arabian Sea to the Bay of
Bengal. In 305 Seleucus Nicator crossed the Indus, but was
defeated by Chandragupta and forced to a humiliating peace
(303), by which the empire of the latter was still farther extended
in the north. About six years later Chandragupta died, leaving
his empire to his son Bindusura.</p>

<p>An excellent account of the court and administrative system
of Chandragupta has been preserved in the fragments of Megasthenes,
who came to Pataliputra as the envoy of Seleucus shortly
after 303. The government was, of course, autocratic and even
tyrannous, but it was organized on an elaborate system, army
and civil service being administered by a series of boards, while
the cities were governed by municipal commissioners responsible
for public order and the upkeep of public works. Chandragupta
himself is described as living in barbaric splendour,
appearing in public only to hear causes, offer sacrifice, or to go
on military and hunting expeditions, and withal so fearful of
assassination that he never slept two nights running in the same
room.</p>

Pasha, bey of Constantine, and became lieutenant-colonel in
1837. The part he took in the expedition of Portes-de-Fer
gained him a colonelcy, and his success against the Hajutas and
Kabyles, the cross of the Legion of Honour. Three more years
of brilliant service in Africa won for him the rank of <i>maréchal
de camp</i> in 1840, and of lieutenant-general in 1843. In 1847 he
held the Algiers divisional command. He visited France early
in 1848, assisted the provisional government to establish order,
and returned to Africa in May to succeed General Cavaignac in
the government of Algeria. He was speedily recalled on his
election to the general assembly for the department of the Seine,
and received the command of the National Guard of Paris, to
which was added soon afterwards that of the troops in Paris,
altogether nearly 100,000 men. He held a high place and
exercised great influence in the complicated politics of the next
two years. In 1849 he received the grand cross of the Legion
of Honour. An avowed enemy of republican institutions, he
held a unique position in upholding the power of the president;
but in January 1851 he opposed Louis Napoleon&rsquo;s policy, was
in consequence deprived of his double command, and at the
<i>coup d&rsquo;état</i> in December was arrested and sent to Mazas, until
his banishment from France by the decree of the 9th of January
1852. He returned to France after the general amnesty, and
resided in his estate in the department of Saône-et-Loire. In
1870 he held no command, but was present with the headquarters,
and afterwards with Bazaine in Metz. He was employed on an
unsuccessful mission to Prince Frederick Charles, commanding
the German army which besieged Metz, and on the capitulation
became a prisoner of war. At the armistice he returned to Paris,
and in 1871 was elected to the National Assembly by four departments,
and sat for the Somme. He took an active part in politics,
defended the conduct of Marshal Bazaine, and served on the
committee which elaborated the monarchical constitution. When
the comte de Chambord refused the compromise, he moved
the resolution to extend the executive power for ten years to
Marshal MacMahon. He was elected a life senator in 1875. He
died in Paris on the 14th of February 1877.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHANG-CHOW,<a name="ar164" id="ar164"></a></span> a town of China, in the province of Fu-kien,
on a branch of the Lung Kiang, 35 m. W. of Amoy. It is
surrounded by a wall 4½ m. in circumference, which, however,
includes a good deal of open ground. The streets are paved with
granite, but are very dirty. The river is crossed by a curious
bridge, 800 ft. long, constructed of wooden planks supported on
twenty-five piles of stones about 30 ft. apart. The city is a centre
of the silk-trade, and carries on an extensive commerce in different
directions. Brick-works and sugar-factories are among its chief
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page840" id="page840"></a>840</span>
industrial establishments. Its population is estimated at about
1,000,000.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHANG CHUN, KIU<a name="ar165" id="ar165"></a></span> (1148-1227), Chinese Taoist sage and
traveller, was born in 1148. In 1219 he was invited by Jenghiz
Khan, founder of the Mongol empire and greatest of Asiatic
conquerors, to visit him. Jenghiz&rsquo; letter of invitation, dated the
15th of May 1219 (by present reckoning), has been preserved,
and is among the curiosities of history; here the terrible warrior
appears as a meek disciple of wisdom, modest and simple,
almost Socratic in his self-examination, alive to many of the
deepest truths of life and government. Chang Chun obeyed this
summons; and leaving his home in Shantung (February 1220)
journeyed first to Peking. Learning that Jenghiz had gone far
west upon fresh conquests, the sage stayed the winter in Peking.
In February 1221 he started again and crossed eastern Mongolia
to the camp of Jenghiz&rsquo; brother Ujughen, near Lake Bör or Buyur
in the upper basin of the Kerulun-Amur. Thence he travelled
south-westward up the Kerulun, crossed the Karakorum region
in north-central Mongolia, and so came to the Chinese Altai,
probably passing near the present Uliassutai. After traversing
the Altai he visited Bishbalig, answering to the modern Urumtsi,
and moved along the north side of the Tian Shan range to lake
Sairam, Almalig (or Kulja), and the rich valley of the Ili. We
then trace him to the Chu, over this river to Talas and the
Tashkent region, and over the Jaxartes (or Syr Daria) to Samarkand,
where he halted for some months. Finally, through the
&ldquo;Iron Gates&rdquo; of Termit, over the Oxus, and by way of Balkh
and northern Afghanistan, Chang Chun reached Jenghiz&rsquo; camp
near the Hindu Kush. Returning home he followed much the
same course as on his outward route: certain deviations, however,
occur, such as a visit to Kuku-khoto. He was back in Peking
by the end of January 1224. From the narrative of his expedition
(the <i>Si yu ki</i>, written by his pupil and companion Li
Chi Chang) we derive some of the most faithful and vivid pictures
ever drawn of nature and man between the Great Wall of China
and Kabul, between the Aral and the Yellow Sea: we may
particularly notice the sketches of the Mongols, and of the
people of Samarkand and its neighbourhood; the account of
the fertility and products of the latter region, as of the Ili valley,
at or near Almalig-Kulja; and the description of various great
mountain ranges, peaks and defiles, such as the Chinese Altai,
the Tian Shan, Mt Bogdo-ola (?), and the Iron Gates of Termit.
There is, moreover, a noteworthy reference to a land apparently
identical with the uppermost valley of the Yenisei. After his
return Chang Chun lived at Peking till his death on the 23rd of
July 1227. By order of Jenghiz some of the former imperial
garden grounds were made over to him, for the foundation of a
Taoist monastery.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHANGE<a name="ar166" id="ar166"></a></span> (derived through the Fr. from the Late Lat. <i>cambium,
cambiare</i>, to barter; the ultimate derivation is probably from
the root which appears in the Gr. <span class="grk" title="kamptein">&#954;&#940;&#956;&#960;&#964;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span>, to bend), properly
the substitution of one thing for another, hence any alteration
or variation, so applied to the moon&rsquo;s passing from one phase to
another. The use of the word for a place of commercial business
has usually been taken to be a shortened form of Exchange (<i>q.v.</i>)
and so is often written &rsquo;Change. The <i>New English Dictionary</i>
points out that &ldquo;change&rdquo; appears earlier than &ldquo;exchange&rdquo;
in this sense. &ldquo;Change&rdquo; is particularly used of coins of lower
denomination given in substitution for those of larger denomination
or for a note, cheque, &amp;c., and also for the balance of a sum
paid larger than that which is due. A further application is that
in bell-ringing, of the variations in order in which a peal of bells
may be rung. The term usually excludes the ringing of the bells
according to the diatonic scale in which they are hung (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bell</a></span>).
It is from a combination of these two meanings that the thieves&rsquo;
slang phrase &ldquo;ringing the changes&rdquo; arises; it denotes the
various methods by which wrong change may be given or
extracted, or counterfeit coin passed.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHANGELING,<a name="ar167" id="ar167"></a></span> the term used of a child substituted or changed
for another, especially in the case of substitutions popularly
supposed to be through fairy agency. There was formerly a
widespread superstition that infants were sometimes stolen
from their cradles by the fairies. Any specially peevish or weakly
baby was regarded as a changeling, the word coming at last to
be almost synonymous with imbecility. It was thought that
the elves could only effect the exchange before christening, and
in the highlands of Scotland babies were strictly watched till
then. Strype states that in his time midwives had to take an
oath binding themselves to be no party to the theft or exchange
of babies. The belief is referred to by Shakespeare, Spenser
and other authors. Pennant, writing in 1796, says: &ldquo;In this
very century a poor cottager, who lived near the spot, had a
child who grew uncommonly peevish; the parents attributed
this to the fairies and imagined it was a changeling. They took
the child, put it in a cradle, and left it all night beneath the
&ldquo;Fairy Oak&rdquo; in hopes that the <i>tylwydd têg</i> or fairy family
would restore their own before morning. When morning came
they found the child perfectly quiet, so went away with it, quite
confirmed in their belief&rdquo; (<i>Tour in Scotland</i>, 1796, p. 257).</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHANGRA,<a name="ar169" id="ar169"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Kanghari</span> (anc. <i>Gangra</i>; called also till the
time of Caracalla, <i>Germanicopolis</i>, after the emperor Claudius),
the chief town of a sanjak of the same name in the Kastamuni
vilayet, Asia Minor, situated in a rich, well-watered valley;
altitude 2500 ft. The ground is impregnated with salt, and
the town is unhealthy. Pop. (1894) 15,632, of whom 1086 are
Christians (Cuinet). Gangra, the capital of the Paphlagonian
kingdom of Deiotarus Philadelphus, son of Castor, was taken
into the Roman province of Galatia on his death in 6-5 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>
The earlier town, the name of which signified &ldquo;she-goat,&rdquo; was
built on the hill behind the modern city, on which are the ruins
of a late fortress; while the Roman city occupied the site of the
modern. In Christian times Gangra was the metropolitan see
of Paphlagonia. In the 4th century the town was the scene of
an important ecclesiastical synod.</p>

<p><i>Synod of Gangra.</i>&mdash;Conjectures as to the date of this synod
vary from 341 to 376. All that can be affirmed with certainty
is that it was held about the middle of the 4th century. The
synodal letter states that twenty-one bishops assembled to take
action concerning Eustathius (of Sebaste?) and his followers,
who contemned marriage, disparaged the offices of the church,
held conventicles of their own, wore a peculiar dress, denounced
riches, and affected especial sanctity. The synod condemned
the Eustathian practices, declaring however, with remarkable
moderation, that it was not virginity that was condemned, but
the dishonouring of marriage; not poverty, but the disparagement
of honest and benevolent wealth; not asceticism, but
spiritual pride; not individual piety, but dishonouring the
house of God. The twenty canons of Gangra were declared
ecumenical by the council of Chalcedon, 451.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHANNEL ISLANDS<a name="ar170" id="ar170"></a></span> (French <i>Îles Normandes</i>), a group of
islands in the English Channel, belonging (except the Îles Chausey)
to Great Britain. (For map, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">England</a></span>, Section VI.) They
lie between 48° 50&prime; and 49° 45&prime; N., and 1° 50&prime; and 2° 45&prime; W.,
along the French coast of Cotentin (department of Manche),
at a distance of 4 to 40 m. from it, within the great rectangular
bay of which the northward horn is Cape La Hague. The greater
part of this bay is shallow, and the currents among the numerous
groups of islands and rocks are often dangerous to navigation.
The nearest point of the English coast to the Channel Islands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page841" id="page841"></a>841</span>
is Portland Bill, a little over 50 m. north of the northernmost
outlier of the islands. The total land area of the islands is about
75 sq. m. (48,083 acres), and the population in 1901 was 95,618.
The principal individual islands are four:&mdash;<span class="sc">Jersey</span> (area 45
sq. m., pop. 52,576), <span class="sc">Guernsey</span> (area 24.5 sq. m., pop. 40,446),
<span class="sc">Alderney</span> (area 3.06 sq. m., pop. 2062), and <span class="sc">Sark</span> (area nearly
2 sq. m., pop. 504). Each of these islands is treated in a separate
article. The chief town and port of Jersey is St Helier, and of
Guernsey St Peter Port; a small town on Alderney is called
St Anne. Regular communication by steamer with Guernsey
and Jersey is provided on alternate days from Southampton and
Weymouth, by steamers of the London &amp; South-Western and
Great Western railway companies of England. Railway communications
within the islands are confined to Jersey. Regular
steamship communications are kept up from certain French
ports, and locally between the larger islands. In summer the
islands, especially Jersey, Guernsey and Sark, are visited by
numerous tourists, both from England and from France.</p>

<p>The islands fall physically into four divisions. The northernmost,
lying due west of Cape La Hague, and separated therefrom
by the narrow Race of Alderney, includes that island, Burhou
and Ortach, and numerous other islets west of it, and west again
the notorious Casquets, <span class="correction" title="amended from 'and'">an</span> angry group of jagged rocks, on the
largest of which is a powerful lighthouse. Doubtful tradition
places here the wreck of the &ldquo;White Ship,&rdquo; in which William,
son of Henry I., perished in 1120; in 1744 the &ldquo;Victory,&rdquo; a
British man-of-war, struck on one of the rocks, and among
calamities of modern times the wreck of the &ldquo;Stella,&rdquo; a passenger
vessel, in 1899, may be recalled. The second division of islands
is also the most westerly; it includes Guernsey with a few islets
to the west, and to the east, Sark, Herm, Jethou (inhabited
islands) and others. The strait between Guernsey and Herm
is called Little Russel, and that between Herm and Sark Great
Russel. Sark is famous for its splendid cliffs and caves, while
Herm possesses the remarkable phenomenon of a shell-beach, or
shore, half-a-mile in length, formed wholly of small shells,
which accumulate in a tidal eddy formed at the north of the
island. To the south-east of these, across the channel called La
Déroute, lies Jersey, forming, with a few attendant islets, of
which the Ecréhou to the north-east are the chief, the third
division. The fourth and southernmost division falls into two
main subdivisions. The Minquiers, the more western, are a
collection of abrupt rocks, the largest of which, Maîtresse Ile,
affords a landing and shelter for fishermen. Then eastern subdivision,
the Îles Chausey, lies about 9 m. west by north of
Granville (to which commune they belong) on the French coast,
and belongs to France. These rocks are close set, low and
curiously regular in form. On Grande Ile, the only permanently
inhabited island (pop. 100), some farming is carried on, and
several of the islets are temporarily inhabited by fishermen.
There is also a little granite-quarrying, and seaweed-burning
employs many.</p>

<p>None of the islands is mountainous, and the fine scenery for
which they are famous is almost wholly coastal. In this respect
each main island has certain distinctive characteristics. Bold
cliffs are found on the south of Alderney; in Guernsey they
alternate with lovely bays; Sark is specially noted for its
magnificent sea-caves, while the coast scenery of Jersey is on
the whole more gentle than the rest.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Geology</i>.&mdash;Geologically, the Channel Islands are closely related
to the neighbouring mainland of Normandy. With a few exceptions,
to be noted later, all the rocks are of pre-Cambrian, perhaps in part of
Archean age. They consist of massive granites, gneisses, diorites,
porphyrites, schists and phyllites, all of which are traversed by
dykes and veins. In Jersey we find in the north-west corner a
granitic tract extending from Grosnez to St Mary and St John,
beyond which it passes into a small granulitic patch. South of the
granites is a schistose area, by St Ouen and St Lawrence, and reaching
to St Aubin&rsquo;s Bay. Granitic masses again appear round St Brelade&rsquo;s
Bay. The eastern half of the island is largely occupied by
porphyrites and similar rocks (hornstone porphyry) with rhyolites
and denitrified obsidians; some of the latter contain large spherulites
with a diameter of as much as 24 in.; these are well exposed in
Bouley Bay; a complex igneous and intrusive series of rocks lies
around St Helier. In the north-east corner of the island a conglomerate,
possibly of Cambrian age, occurs between Bouley Bay
and St Catherine&rsquo;s Bay. Tracts of blown-sand cover the ground
for some distance north of St Clement&rsquo;s Bay and again east of
St Ouen&rsquo;s Bay. In the sea off the latter bay a submerged forest
occurs. The northern half of Guernsey is mainly dioritic, the
southern half, below St Peter, is occupied by gneisses. Several
patches of granite and granulite fringe the western coast, the largest
of these is a hornblende granite round Rocquaine Bay. Hornblende
gneiss from St Sampson and quartz diorite from Capelles,
Corvée and elsewhere are transported to England for road metal.
Sark is composed almost wholly of hornblende-schists and gneisses
with hornblendic granite at the north end of the island, in Little
Sark and in the middle of Bréchou. Dykes of diabase and diorite
are abundant. Alderney consists mainly of hornblende granite and
granulite, which are covered on the east by two areas of sandstone
which may be of Cambrian age. An enstatite-augite-diorite is sent
from Alderney for road-making. Besides the submerged forest on
the coast of Jersey already mentioned, there are similar occurrences
near St Peter Port and St Sampson&rsquo;s harbour, and in Vazon Bay
in Guernsey. Raised beaches are to be seen at several points in the
islands.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Climate</i>.&mdash;The climate is mild and very pleasant. In Jersey
the mean temperature for twenty years is found to be&mdash;in January
(the coldest month) 42.1° F., in August (the hottest) 63°, mean
annual 51.7°. In Guernsey the figures are, for January 42.5°,
for August 59.7°, mean annual 49.5°. The mean annual rainfall
for twenty-five years in Jersey is 34.21 in., and in Guernsey 38.64
in. The average amount of sunshine in Jersey is considerably
greater than in the most favoured spots on the south coast of
England; and in Guernsey it is only a little less than in Jersey.
Snow and frost are rare, and the seasons of spring and autumn
are protracted. Thick sea-fogs are not uncommon, especially
in May and June.</p>

<p><i>Flora and Fauna.</i>&mdash;The flora of the islands is remarkably rich,
considering their extent, nearly 2000 different species of plants
having been counted throughout the group. Of timber properly
speaking there is little, but the evergreen oak, the elm and the
beech are abundant. Wheat is the principal grain in cultivation;
but far more ground is taken up with turnips and potatoes,
mangold, parsnip and carrot. The tomato ripens as in France,
and the Chinese yam has been successfully grown. There is a
curious cabbage, chiefly cultivated in Jersey, which shoots up
into a long woody stalk from 10 to 15 ft. in height, fit for walking-sticks
or palisades. Grapes and peaches come to perfection in
greenhouses without artificial heat; and not only apples and
pears but oranges and figs can be reared in the open air. The
arbutus ripens its fruit, and the camellia clothes itself with
blossom, as in more southern climates; the fuchsia reaches a
height of 15 or 20 ft., and the magnolia attains the dimensions
of a tree. Of the flowers, both indigenous and exotic, that
abound throughout the islands, it is sufficient to mention the
Guernsey lily with its rich red petals, which is supposed to have
been brought from Japan.</p>

<p>The number of the species of the mammalia is little over
twenty, and several of these have been introduced by man.
There is a special breed of horned cattle, and each island has its
own variety, which is carefully kept from all intermixture. The
animals are small and delicate, and marked by a peculiar yellow
colour round the eyes and within the ears. The red deer was once
indigenous, and the black rat is still common in Alderney, Sark
and Herm. The list of birds includes nearly 200 species, nearly
100 of which are permanent inhabitants of the islands. There
are few localities in the northern seas which are visited by a
greater variety of fish, and the coasts abound in crustacea,
shell-fish and zoophytes.</p>

<p><i>Government</i>.&mdash;For the purposes of government the Channel
Islands (excluding the French Chauseys) are divided into two
divisions:&mdash;(1) Jersey, and (2) the bailiwick of Guernsey, which
includes Alderney, Sark, Herm and Jethou with the island of
Guernsey. The constitutions of each division are peculiar and
broadly similar, but differing in certain important details; they
may therefore be considered together for the sake of comparison.
Until 1854 governors were appointed by the crown; now a
separate military lieutenant-governor is appointed for each
division on the recommendation of the war office after consultation
with the home office. The other crown officials are the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page842" id="page842"></a>842</span>
bailiff (<i>bailli</i>) or chief magistrate, the <i>procureur du roi</i>, representing
the attorney-general, and the <i>avocat du roi</i>, or in Guernsey
the <i>contrôle</i>, representing the solicitor-general. In Jersey the
<i>vicomte</i> is also appointed by the crown, in the position of a high
sheriff (and coroner); but his counterpart in Guernsey, the
<i>prévôt</i>, is not so appointed. The bailiff in each island is president
of the royal court, which is composed of twelve jurats, elected for
life, in Jersey by the ratepayers of each parish, in Guernsey by
the Elective States, a body which also elects the <i>prévôt</i>, who,
with the jurats, serves upon it. The rest of the body is made up
of the rectors of the parishes, the <i>douzaines</i>, or elected parish
councils (&ldquo;dozens,&rdquo; from the original number of their members)
of the town parish of St Peter Port, the four cantons, and the
county parishes, and certain other officials. The royal court
administers justice (but in Jersey there is a trial by jury for
criminal cases), and in Guernsey can pass temporary ordinances
subject to no higher body. It also puts forward <i>projets de loi</i>
for the approval of the Deliberative States. Alderney and Sark
have a separate legal existence with courts dependent on the
royal court of Guernsey. In both Jersey and Guernsey the chief
administrative body is the Deliberative States. The Jersey States
is composed of the lieutenant-governor (who has a veto on the
deliberation of any question, but no vote), the bailiff, jurats,
parish rectors, parish constables and deputies, the <i>procureur</i>
and <i>avocat</i>, with right to speak but no vote, and the <i>vicomte</i>,
with right of attendance only. Besides the veto of the lieutenant-governor,
the bailiff has the power to dissent from any measure,
in which case it is referred to the privy council. In Guernsey the
States consists of the bailiff, jurats, eight out of ten rectors, the
<i>procureur</i> and deputies; while the lieutenant-governor is always
invited and may speak if he attends. By both States local
administration is carried on (largely through committees); and
relations with the British parliament are maintained through the
privy council. Acts of parliament are transmitted to the islands
by an order in council to be registered in the rolls of the royal
court, and are not considered to be binding until this is done;
moreover, registration may be held over pending discussion by
the States if any act is considered to menace the privileges of
the islands. The right of the crown to legislate by order in council
is held to be similarly limited. In cases of encroachment on
property, a remarkable form of appeal of very ancient origin
called <i>Clameur de Haro</i> survives (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Haro, Clameur de</a></span>). The
islands are in the diocese of Winchester, and there is a dean
in both Jersey and Guernsey, who is also rector of a parish.</p>

<p>These peculiar constitutions are of local development, the
history of which is obscure. The bailiff was originally assisted
in his judicial work by itinerant justices; their place was later
taken by the elected jurats; later still the practice of summoning
the States to assist in the passing of Ordinances was established
by the bailiff and jurats, and at last the States claimed the
absolute right of being consulted. This was confirmed to them
in 1771.</p>

<p>It is characteristic of these islands that there should be
compulsory service in the militia. In Jersey and Alderney every
man between the ages of sixteen and forty-five is liable, but in
Jersey after ten years&rsquo; service militiamen are transferred to the
reserve. In Guernsey the age limit is from sixteen to thirty-three,
and the obligation is extended to all who are British
subjects, and draw income from a profession practised in the
island. Garrisons of regular troops are maintained in all three
islands. Taxation is light in the islands, and pauperism is
practically unknown.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In 1904 the revenue of Jersey was £70,191, and its expenditure
£69,658; the revenue of Guernsey was £79,334, and the expenditure
£43,385. The public debt in the respective islands was £322,070
and £195,794. In Jersey the annual revenues from crown rights
(principally seigneurial dues, houses and lands and tithes) amount
to about £2700, and about £360 is remitted to the paymaster-general.
In Guernsey these revenues, in which the principal item is fines on
transference of property (<i>treizièmes</i> or fees), amount to about £4500,
and about £1000 is remitted. In Alderney the revenues (chiefly from
harbour dues) amount to about £1400.</p>

<p>In Jersey the English gold and silver coinage are current, but there
is a local copper coinage and local one-pound notes are issued.
Guernsey has also such notes, and its copper coinage consists of
pence, halfpence, two-double and one-double (one-eighth of a penny)
pieces. A Guernsey pound is taken as equal to 24 francs, and
English and French currency pass equally throughout the islands.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Industry</i>.&mdash;The old Norman system of land-tenure has survived,
and the land is parcelled out among a great number of
small proprietors; holdings ranging from 5 to 25 acres as a rule.
The results of this arrangement seem to be favourable in the
extreme. Every corner of the ground is carefully and intelligently
cultivated, and a considerable proportion is allotted to
market-gardening. The cottages are neat and comfortable,
the hedges well-trimmed, and the roads kept in excellent repair.
There is a considerable export trade in agricultural produce and
stock, including vegetables and fruit, in fish (the fisheries
forming an important industry) and in stone. There is no
manufacture of importance. The inhabitants share in common
the right of collecting and burning seaweed (called <i>vraic</i>) for
manure. The cutting of the weed (vraicking) became a ceremonial
occasion, taking place at times fixed by the government,
and connected with popular festivities.</p>

<p><i>Language</i>.&mdash;The language spoken in ordinary life by the
inhabitants of the islands is in great measure the same as the old
Norman French. The use of the <i>patois</i> has decreased naturally
in modern times. Modern French is the official language, used
in the courts and states, and English is taught in the parochial
schools, and is familiar practically to all. The several islands
have each its own dialect, differing from that of the others
in vocabulary and idiom; differences are also observable in
different localities within the same island, as between the north
and the south of Guernsey. None of the dialects has received
much literary cultivation, though Jersey is proud of being the
birthplace of one of the principal Norman poets, Wace, who
flourished in the 12th century.</p>

<p><i>History</i>.&mdash;The original ethnology and pre-Christian history
of the Channel Islands are largely matters of conjecture and
debate. Of early inhabitants abundant proof is afforded by the
numerous megalithic monuments&mdash;cromlechs, kistvaens and
maenhirs&mdash;still extant. But little trace has been left of Roman
occupation, and such remains as have been discovered are mainly
of the portable description that affords little proof of actual
settlement, though there may have been an unimportant garrison
here. The constant recurrence of the names of saints in the
place-names of the islands, and the fact that pre-Christian names
do not occur, leads to the inference that before Christianity was
introduced the population was very scanty. It may be considered
to have consisted originally of Bretons (Celts), and to
have received successively a slight admixture of Romans and
Legionaries, Saxons and perhaps Jutes and Vandals. Christianity
may have been introduced in the 5th century. Guernsey
is said to have been visited in the 6th century by St Sampson of
Dol (whose name is given to a small town and harbour in the
island), St Marcou or Marculfus and St Magloire, a friend and
fellow-evangelist of St Sampson, who founded monasteries at
Sark and at Jersey, and died in Jersey in 575. Another evangelist
of this period was St Helerius, whose name is borne by the chief
town of Jersey, St Helier. In his life it is stated that the population
of the island when he reached it was only 30. In 933 the
islands were made over to William, duke of Normandy (d. 943),
and after the Norman conquest of England their allegiance shifted
between the English crown and the Norman coronet according to
the vicissitudes of war and policy. During the purely Norman
period they had been enriched with numerous ecclesiastical
buildings, some of which are still extant, as the chapel of Rozel
in Jersey.</p>

<p>In the reign of John of England the future of the islands was
decided by their attachment to the English crown, in spite of the
separation of the duchy of Normandy. To John it has been usual
to ascribe a document, at one time regarded by the islanders as
their Magna Carta; but modern criticism leaves little doubt
that it is not genuine. An unauthenticated &ldquo;copy&rdquo; of uncertain
origin alone has been discovered, and there is little proof of
there ever having been an original. The reign of Edward I. was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page843" id="page843"></a>843</span>
full of disturbance; and in 1279 Jersey and Guernsey received
from the king, by letters patent, a public seal as a remedy for the
dangers and losses which they had incurred by lack of such a
certificate. Edward II. found it necessary to instruct his
collectors not to treat the islanders as foreigners: his successor,
Edward III., fully confirmed their privileges, immunities and
customs in 1341; and his charter was recognized by Richard II.
in 1378. In 1343 there was a descent of the French on Guernsey;
the governor was defeated, and Castle Cornet besieged. In 1372
there was another attack on Guernsey, and in 1374 and 1404 the
French descended on Jersey. None of these attempts, however,
resulted in permanent settlement. Henry V. confiscated the
alien priories which had kept up the same connexion with Normandy
as before the conquest, and conferred them along with the
regalities of the islands on his brother, the duke of Bedford.
During the Wars of the Roses, Queen Margaret, the consort of
Henry VI., made an agreement with Pierre de Brézé, comte de
Maulevrier, the seneschal of Normandy, that if he afforded
assistance to the king he should hold the islands independently
of the crown. A force was accordingly sent to take possession of
Mont Orgueil. It was captured and a small part of the island
subjugated, and here Maulevrier remained as governor from 1460
to 1465; but the rest held out under Sir Philip de Carteret,
seigneur of St Ouen, and in 1467 the vice-admiral of England,
Sir Richard Harliston, recaptured the castle and brought the
foreign occupation to an end. In 1482-1483 Pope Sixtus IV., at
the instance of King Edward IV., issued a bull of anathema
against all who molested the islands; it was formally registered
in Brittany in 1484, and in France in 1486; and in this way the
islands acquired the right of neutrality, which they retained till
1689. In the same reign (Edward IV.) Sark was taken by the
French, and only recovered in the reign of Mary, by the strategy
(according to tradition) of landing from a vessel a coffin nominally
containing a body for burial, but in reality filled with arms.
By a charter of 1494, the duties of the governors of Jersey were
defined and their power restricted; and the educational interests
of the island were furthered at the same time by the foundation
of two grammar schools. The religious establishments in the
islands were dissolved, as in England, in the reign of Henry VIII.
The Reformation was heartily welcomed in the islands. The
English liturgy was translated into French for their use. In the
reign of Mary there was much religious persecution; and in that of
Elizabeth Roman Catholics were maltreated in their turn. In
1568 the islands were attached to the see of Winchester, being
finally separated from that of Coutances, with which they had
long been connected, with short intervals in the reign of John,
when they had belonged to the see of Exeter, and that of Henry
VI., when they had belonged to Salisbury.</p>

<p>The Presbyterian form of church government was adopted
under the influence of refugees from the persecution of Protestantism
on the continent. It was formally sanctioned in St Helier and
St Peter Port by Queen Elizabeth; and in 1603 King James
enacted that the whole of the islands &ldquo;should quietly enjoy
their said liberty.&rdquo; During his reign, however, disputes arose.
An Episcopal party had been formed in Jersey, and in 1619
David Bandinel was declared dean of the island. A body of
canons which he drew up agreeable to the discipline of the Church
of England was accepted after considerable modification by the
people of his charge; but the inhabitants of Guernsey maintained
their Presbyterian practices. Of the hold which this form of
Protestantism had got on the minds of the people even in Jersey
abundant proof is afforded by the general character of the worship
at the present day.</p>

<p>In the great struggle between king and parliament, Presbyterian
Guernsey supported the parliament; in Jersey, however, there
were at first parliamentarian and royalist factions. Sir Philip de
Carteret, lieutenant-governor, declared for the king, but Dean
Bandinel and Michael Lemprière, a leader of the people, headed
the parliamentary party. They received a commission for the
apprehension of Carteret, who established himself in Elizabeth
Castle; but after some fighting had taken place he died in the
castle in August 1643. Meanwhile in Guernsey Sir Peter Osborne,
the governor, was defying the whole island and maintaining
himself in Castle Cornet. A parliamentarian governor, Leonard
Lydcott, arrived in Jersey immediately after Sir Philip de
Carteret&rsquo;s death. But the dowager Lady Carteret was holding
Mont Orgueil; George Carteret, Sir Philip&rsquo;s nephew, arrived
from St Malo to support the royalist cause, and Lydcott and
Lemprière presently fled to England. George Carteret established
himself as lieutenant-governor and bailiff. Bandinel was
imprisoned in Mont Orgueil, and killed himself in trying to
escape. Jersey was now completely royalist. In 1646 the prince
of Wales, afterwards Charles II., arrived secretly at Jersey, and
remained over two months at Elizabeth Castle. He went on to
France, but returned in 1649, having been proclaimed king by
George Carteret, and at Elizabeth Castle he signed the declaration
of his claims to the throne on the 29th of October. In 1651,
when Charles had fled to France again after the battle of
Worcester, parliamentarian vessels of war appeared at Jersey.
The islanders, weary of the tyrannical methods of their governor,
now Sir George Carteret, offered little resistance. On the 15th of
December the royalist remnant yielded up Elizabeth Castle;
and at the same time Castle Cornet, Guernsey, which had been
steadily held by Osborne, capitulated. In each case honourable
terms of surrender were granted. Both islands had suffered
severely from the struggle, and the people of Guernsey, appealing
to Cromwell on the ground of their support of his cause, complained
that two-thirds of the land was out of cultivation, and
that they had lost &ldquo;their ships, their traffic and their trading.&rdquo;
After the Restoration there was considerable improvement, and
in the reign of James II. the islanders got a grant of wool for the
manufacture of stockings&mdash;4000 tods<a name="fa1f" id="fa1f" href="#ft1f"><span class="sp">1</span></a> of wool being annually
allowed to Jersey, 2000 to Guernsey, 400 to Alderney and 200 to
Sark. Alderney, which had been parliamentarian, was granted
after the Restoration to the Carteret family; and it continued to
be governed independently till 1825.</p>

<p>By William of Orange the neutrality of the islands was
abolished in 1689, and during the war between England and
France (1778-1783) there were two unsuccessful attacks on
Jersey, in 1779 and 1781, the second, under Baron de Rullecourt,
being famous for the victory over the invaders due to the bravery
of the young Major Peirson, who fell when the French were on the
point of surrender. During the revolutionary period in France
the islands were the home of many refugees. In the 18th century
various attempts were made to introduce the English custom-house
system; but proved practically a failure, and the islands
throve on smuggling and privateering down to 1800.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHANNING, WILLIAM ELLERY<a name="ar171" id="ar171"></a></span> (1780-1842), American
divine and philanthropist, was born in Newport, Rhode Island,
on the 7th of April 1780. His maternal grandfather was William
Ellery, a signer of the Declaration of Independence; his mother,
Lucy Ellery, was a remarkable woman; and his father, William
Channing, was a prominent lawyer in Newport. Channing had as
a child a refined delicacy of feature and temperament, and seemed
to have inherited from his father simple and elegant tastes,
sweetness of temper, and warmth of affection, and from his
mother that strong moral discernment and straightforward
rectitude of purpose and action which formed so striking a feature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page844" id="page844"></a>844</span>
of his character. From his earliest years he delighted in the
beauty of the scenery of Newport, and always highly estimated
its influence upon his spiritual character. His father was a strict
Calvinist, and Dr Samuel Hopkins, one of the leaders of the old
school Calvinists, was a frequent guest in his father&rsquo;s house.
He was, even as a child, he himself says, &ldquo;quite a theologian,
and would chop logic with his elders according to the fashion of
that controversial time.&rdquo; He prepared for college in New London
under the care of his uncle, the Rev. Henry Channing, and in
1794, about a year after the death of his father, entered Harvard
College. Before leaving New London he came under religious
influences to which he traced the beginning of his spiritual life.
In his college vacations he taught at Lancaster, Massachusetts,
and in term time he stinted himself in food that he might need
less exercise and so save time for study,&mdash;an experiment which
undermined his health, producing acute dyspepsia. From his
college course he thought that he got little good, and said &ldquo;when
I was in college, only three books that I read were of any moment
to me:  ... Ferguson on <i>Civil Society</i>, ... Hutcheson&rsquo;s
<i>Moral Philosophy</i>, and Price&rsquo;s <i>Dissertations</i>. Price saved me
from Locke&rsquo;s philosophy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After graduating in 1798, he lived at Richmond, Virginia, as
tutor in the family of David Meade Randolph, United States
marshal for Virginia. Here he renewed his ascetic habits and
spent much time in theological study, his mind being greatly
disturbed in regard to Trinitarian teachings in general and
especially prayer to Jesus. He returned to Newport in 1800
&ldquo;a thin and pallid invalid,&rdquo; spent a year and a half there, and
in 1802 went to Cambridge as regent (or general proctor) in
Harvard; in the autumn of 1802 he began to preach, having
been approved by the Cambridge Association. On the 1st of
June 1803, having refused the more advantageous pastorate of
Brattle Street church, he was ordained pastor of the Federal
Street Congregational church in Boston. At this time it seems
certain that his theological views were not fixed, and in 1808,
when he preached a sermon at the ordination of the Rev. John
Codman (1782-1847), he still applied the title &ldquo;Divine Master&rdquo;
to Jesus Christ, and used such expressions as &ldquo;shed for souls&rdquo; of
the blood of Jesus, and &ldquo;the Son of God himself left the abodes
of glory and expired a victim of the cross.&rdquo; But his sermon
preached in 1819 at Baltimore at the ordination of the Rev.
Jared Sparks was in effect a powerful attack on Trinitarianism,
and was followed in 1819 by an article in <i>The Christian Disciple</i>,
&ldquo;Objections to Unitarian Christianity Considered,&rdquo; and in 1820
by another, &ldquo;The Moral Argument against Calvinism&rdquo;&mdash;an
excellent evidence of the moral (rather than the intellectual)
character of Unitarian protest. In 1814 he had married a rich
cousin, Ruth Gibbs, but refused to make use of the income from
her property on the ground that clergymen were so commonly
accused of marrying for money.</p>

<p>He was now entering on his public career. Even in 1810, in a
Fast Day sermon, he warned his congregation of Bonaparte&rsquo;s
ambition; two years later he deplored &ldquo;this country taking part
with the oppressor against that nation which has alone arrested
his proud career of victory&rdquo;; in 1814 he preached a thanksgiving
sermon for the overthrow of Napoleon; and in 1816 he
preached a sermon on war which led to the organization of the
Massachusetts Peace Society. His sermon on &ldquo;Religion, a
Social Principle,&rdquo; helped to procure the omission from the state
constitution of the third article of Part I., which made compulsory
a tax for the support of religious worship. In 1821 he delivered
the Dudleian lecture on the &ldquo;Evidences of Revealed Religion&rdquo;
at Harvard, of whose corporation he had been a member since
1813; he had received its degree of S.T.D. in 1820. In August
1821 he undertook a journey to Europe, in the course of which
he met in England many distinguished men of letters, especially
Wordsworth and Coleridge. Both of these poets greatly influenced
him personally and by their writings, and he prophesied
that the Lake poets would be one of the greatest forces in a
forming spiritual reform. Coleridge wrote of him, &ldquo;He has the
love of wisdom and the wisdom of love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On his return to America in August 1823, Dr Channing resumed
his duties as pastor, but with a more decided attention than
before to literature and public affairs, especially after receiving
as colleague, in 1824, the Rev. Ezra Stiles Gannett. In 1830,
because of his wife&rsquo;s bad health, Channing went to the West
Indies. Negro slavery, as he saw it there, and as he had seen it
in Richmond, more than thirty years before, so strongly impressed
him that he began to write his book <i>Slavery</i> (1835).
In this he insists that &ldquo;not what is profitable, but what is right&rdquo;
is &ldquo;the first question to be proposed by a rational being&rdquo;; that
slavery ought to be discussed &ldquo;with a deep feeling of responsibility,
and so done as not to put in jeopardy the peace of the slave-holding
states&rdquo;; that &ldquo;man cannot be justly held and used as
property&rdquo;; that the tendency of slavery is morally, intellectually,
and domestically, bad; that emancipation, however,
should not be forced on slave-holders by governmental interference,
but by an enlightened public conscience in the South
(and in the North), if for no other reason, because &ldquo;slavery
should be succeeded by a friendly relation between master and
slave; and to produce this the latter must see in the former his
benefactor and deliverer.&rdquo; He declined to identify himself
with the Abolitionists, whose motto was &ldquo;Immediate Emancipation&rdquo;
and whose passionate agitation he thought unsuited to
the work they were attempting. The moderation and temperance
of his presentation of the anti-slavery cause naturally resulted in
some misunderstanding and misstatement of his position, such as
is to be found in Mrs Chapman&rsquo;s <i>Appendix</i> to the <i>Autobiography
of Harriet Martineau</i>, where Channing is represented as actually
using his influence on behalf of slavery. In 1837 he published
<i>Thoughts on the Evils of a Spirit of Conquest, and on Slavery: A
Letter on the Annexation of Texas to the United States</i>, addressed
to Henry Clay, and arguing that the Texan revolt from Mexican
rule was largely the work of land-speculators, and of those who
resolved &ldquo;to throw Texas open to slave-holders and slaves&rdquo;;
that the results of annexation must be war with Mexico, embroiling
the United States with England and other European powers,
and at home the extension and perpetuation of slavery, not alone
in Texas but in other territories which the United States, once
started at conquest, would force into the Union. But he still
objected to political agitation by the Abolitionists, preferring
&ldquo;unremitting appeals to the reason and conscience,&rdquo; and, even
after the prominent part he took in the meeting in Faneuil Hall,
called to protest against the murder of Elijah P. Lovejoy, he
wrote to <i>The Liberator</i>, counselling the Abolitionists to &ldquo;disavow
this resort to force by Mr Lovejoy.&rdquo; Channing&rsquo;s pamphlet
<i>Emancipation</i> (1840) dealt with the success of emancipation
in the West Indies, as related in Joseph John Gurney&rsquo;s <i>Familiar
Letters to Henry Clay of Kentucky, describing a Winter in the
West Indies</i> (1840), and added his own advice &ldquo;that we should
each of us bear our conscientious testimony against slavery,&rdquo;
and that the Free States &ldquo;abstain as rigidly from the use of
political power against Slavery in the States where it is established,
as from exercising it against Slavery in foreign communities,&rdquo;
and should free themselves &ldquo;from any obligation
to use the powers of the national or state governments in any
manner whatever for the support of slavery.&rdquo; In 1842 he published
<i>The Duty of the Free States</i>, or <i>Remarks Suggested by the
Case of the Creole</i>, a careful analysis of the letter of complaint from
the American to the British government, and a defence of the
position taken by the British government. On the 1st of August
1842 he delivered at Lenox, Massachusetts, an address celebrating
the anniversary of emancipation in the British West Indies.
Two months later, on the 2nd of October 1842, he died at
Bennington, Vermont.</p>

<p>Physically Channing was short and slight; his eyes were unnaturally
large; his voice wonderfully clear, and like his face,
filled with devotional spirit. He was not a great pastor, and
lacked social tact, so that there were not many people who
became his near friends; but by the few who knew him well,
he was almost worshipped. As a preacher Channing was often
criticised for his failure to deal with the practical everyday
duties of life. But his sermons are remarkable for their rare
simplicity and gracefulness of style as well as for the thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page845" id="page845"></a>845</span>
that they express. The first open defence of Unitarians was
not based on doctrinal differences but on the peculiar nature
of the attack on them made in June 1815 by the conservatives
in the columns of <i>The Panoplist</i>, where it was stated that Unitarians
were &ldquo;operating only in secret, ... guilty of hypocritical
concealment of their sentiments.&rdquo; His chief objection to the
doctrine of the Trinity (as stated in his sermon at the ordination
of the Rev. Jared Sparks) was that it was no longer used philosophically,
as showing God&rsquo;s relation to the triple nature of
man, but that it had lapsed into mere Tritheism. To the name
&ldquo;Unitarian&rdquo; Channing objected strongly, thinking &ldquo;unity&rdquo;
as abstract a word as &ldquo;trinity&rdquo; and as little expressing the
close fatherly relation of God to man. It is to be noted that
he strongly objected to the growth of &ldquo;Unitarian orthodoxy&rdquo;
and its increasing narrowness. His views as to the divinity
of Jesus were based on phrases in the Gospels which to his mind
established Christ&rsquo;s admission of inferiority to God the Father,&mdash;for
example, &ldquo;Knoweth no man, neither the Son, but the
Father&rdquo;; at the same time he regarded Christ as &ldquo;the sinless
and spotless son of God, distinguished from all men by that
infinite peculiarity&mdash;freedom from moral evil.&rdquo; He believed
in the pre-existence of Jesus, and that it differed from the pre-existence
of other souls in that Jesus was actually conscious
of such pre-existence, and he reckoned him one with God the
Father in the sense of spiritual union (and not metaphysical
mystery) in the same way that Jesus bade his disciples &ldquo;Be ye
one, even as I am one.&rdquo; Bunsen called him &ldquo;the prophet in the
United States for the presence of God in mankind.&rdquo; Channing
believed in historic Christianity and in the story of the resurrection,
&ldquo;a fact which comes to me with a certainty I find in few
ancient histories.&rdquo; He also believed in the miracles of the
Gospels, but held that the Scriptures were not inspired, but
merely records of inspiration, and so saw the possibility of error
in the construction put upon miracles by the ignorant disciples.
But in only a few instances did he refuse full credence of the
plain gospel narrative of miracles. He held, however, that the
miracles were facts and not &ldquo;evidences&rdquo; of Christianity, and
he considered that belief in them followed and did not lead up to
belief in Christianity. His character was absolutely averse from
controversy of any sort, and in controversies into which he was
forced he was free from any theological odium and continually
displayed the greatest breadth and catholicity of view. The
differences in New England churches he considered were
largely verbal, and he said that &ldquo;would Trinitarians tell us what
they mean, their system would generally be found little else
than a mystical form of the Unitarian doctrine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His opposition to Calvinism was so great that even in 1812
he declared &ldquo;existence a curse&rdquo; if Calvinism be true. Possibly
his boldest and most elaborate defence of Unitarianism was
his sermon on <i>Unitarianism most favourable to Piety</i>, preached in
1826, criticizing as it did the doctrine of atonement by the
sacrifice of an &ldquo;infinite substitute&rdquo;; and the Election Sermon
of 1830 was his greatest plea for spiritual and intellectual
freedom.</p>

<p>Channing&rsquo;s reputation as an author was probably based
largely on his publication in <i>The Christian Examiner</i> of <i>Remarks
on the Character and Writings of John Milton</i> (1826), <i>Remarks on
the Life and Character of Napoleon Bonaparte</i> (1827-1828), and
an <i>Essay on the Character and Writings of Fénelon</i> (1829). An
<i>Essay on Self-Culture</i> (1838) was an address introducing the
Franklin Lectures delivered in Boston September 1838. Channing
was an intimate friend of Horace Mann, and his views on
the education of children are stated, by no less an authority
than Elizabeth Palmer Peabody, to have anticipated those of
Froebel. His <i>Complete Works</i> have appeared in various editions
(5 vols., Boston, 1841; 2 vols., London, 1865; 1 vol., New
York, 1875).</p>

<p>Among members of his family may be mentioned his two
nephews William Henry (1810-1884), son of his brother Francis
Dana, and William Ellery, commonly known as Ellery (1818-1901),
son of his brother Walter, a Boston physician (1786-1876).
The former, whose daughter married Sir Edwin Arnold, the
English poet, became a Unitarian pastor, for some time in
America, and also in England, where he died; he was deeply
interested in Christian Socialism, and was a constant writer,
translating Jouffroy&rsquo;s <i>Ethics</i> (1840), and assisting in editing the
<i>Memoirs of Margaret Fuller</i> (1852); and he wrote the biography
of his uncle (see O.B. Frothingham&rsquo;s <i>Memoir</i>, 1886). Ellery
Channing married Margaret Fuller&rsquo;s sister (1842), and besides
critical essays and poems published an intimate sketch of
Thoreau in 1873.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHANSONS DE GESTE,<a name="ar172" id="ar172"></a></span> the name given to the epic chronicles
which take so prominent a place in the literature of France from
the 11th to the 15th century. Gaston Paris defined a chanson
de geste as a song the subject of which is a series of historical
facts or <i>gesta</i>. These facts form the centre around which are
grouped sets of poems, called cycles, and hence the two terms
have in modern criticism become synonymous for the epic
family to which the hero of the particular group or cycle belongs.
The earliest chansons de geste were founded on the fusion of the
Teutonic spirit, under a Roman form, into the new Christian
and French civilization. It seems probable that as early as the
9th century epic poems began to be chanted by the itinerant
minstrels who are known as jongleurs. It is conjectured that
in a base Latin fragment of the 10th century we possess a translation
of a poem on the siege of Girona. Gaston Paris dates from
this lost epic the open expression of what he calls &ldquo;the epic
fermentation&rdquo; of France. But the earliest existing chanson
de geste is also by far the noblest and most famous, the <i>Chanson
de Roland</i>; the conjectural date of the composition of this poem
has been placed between the years 1066 and 1095. That the
author, as has been supposed, was one of the conquerors of
England, it is perhaps rash to assert, but undoubtedly the poem
was composed before the First Crusade, and the writer lived at
or near the sanctuary of Mont Saint-Michel. The <i>Chanson de
Roland</i> stands at the head of modern French literature, and its
solidity and grandeur give a dignity to the whole class of poetry
of which it is the earliest and by far the noblest example. But
it is in the crowd of looser and later poems, less fully characterized,
less steeped in the individuality of their authors, that we
can best study the form of the typical chanson de geste. These
epics sprang from the soil of France; they were national and
historical; their anonymous writers composed them spontaneously,
to a common model, with little regard to the artificial
niceties of style. The earlier examples, which succeed the
<i>Roland</i>, are unlike that great work in having no plan, no system
of composition. They are improvisations which wander on at
their own pace, whither accident may carry them. This mass of
medieval literature is monotonous, primitive and superficial.
As Léon Gautier has said, in the rudimentary psychology of
the chansons de geste, man is either entirely good or entirely
bad. There are no fine shades, no observation of character.
The language in which these poems are composed is extremely
simple, without elaboration, without ornament. Everything
is sacrificed to the telling of a story by a narrator of little skill,
who helps himself along by means of a picturesque, but almost
childish fancy, and a primitive sentiment of rhythm. Two great
merits, however, all the best of these poems possess, force and
lucidity; and they celebrate, what they did much to create, that
unselfish elevation of temper which we call the spirit of chivalry.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important cycle of chansons de geste was
that which was collected around the name of Charlemagne, and
was known as the <i>Geste du roi</i>. A group of this cycle dealt with
the history of the mother of the emperor, and with Charlemagne
himself down to the coming of Roland. To this group belong
<i>Bertha Greatfoot</i> and <i>Aspremont</i>, both of the 12th century, and
a variety of chansons dealing with the childhood of Charlemagne
and of Ogier the Dane. A second group deals with the struggle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page846" id="page846"></a>846</span>
of Charlemagne with his rebellious vassals. This is what has
been defined as the Feudal Epic; it includes <i>Girars de Viane</i>
and <i>Ogier the Dane</i>, both of the 13th century, or the end of the
12th. A third group follows Charlemagne and his peers to the
East. It is in the principal of these poems, <i>The Pilgrimage to
Jerusalem</i>, that Alexandrine verse first makes its appearance in
French literature. This must belong to the beginning of the
12th century. A fourth group, antecedent to the Spanish war,
is of the end of the 12th century and the beginning of the 13th;
it includes <i>Aiquin</i>, <i>Fierabras</i> and <i>Otinel</i>. The fifth class discusses
the war in Spain, and it is to this that <i>Roland</i> belongs; there are
different minor epics dealing with the events of Roncevaux, and
independent chansons of <i>Gui de Bourgogne</i>, <i>Gaidon</i> and <i>Anseïs
de Carthage</i>. The <i>Geste du Roi</i> comprises a sixth and last group,
proceeding with events up to the death of Charlemagne; this
contains <i>Huon de Bordeaux</i> and a vast number of poems of
minor originality and importance.</p>

<p>Another cycle is that of Duke William Shortnose, <i>La Geste de
Guillaume</i>. This includes the very early and interesting <i>Departure
of the Aimeri Children</i>, <i>Aliscans</i> and <i>Rainoart</i>. It is
thought that this cycle, which used to be called the <i>Geste de
Garin de Monglane</i>, is less artificial than the others; it deals
with the heroes of the South who remained faithful in their
vassalage to the throne. The poems belonging to this cycle are
extremely numerous, and some of them are among the earliest
which survive. These chansons find their direct opposites in
those which form the great cycle of <i>La Geste de Doon de Mayence</i>,
sometimes called &ldquo;la faulse geste,&rdquo; because it deals with the
feats of the traitors, of the rebellious family of Ganelon. This
is the geste of the Northmen, always hostile to the Carlovingian
dynasty. It comprises some of the most famous of the chansons,
in particular <i>Parise la duchesse</i> and <i>The Four Sons of Aymon</i>.
Several of its sections are the production of a known poet,
Raimbert of Paris. From this triple division of the main body
of the chansons de geste into <i>La Geste du Roi</i>, <i>La Geste de Guillaume</i>
and <i>La Geste de Doon</i>, are excluded certain poems of minor
importance,&mdash;some provincial, such as <i>Amis and Amiles</i> and
<i>Garin</i>, some dealing with the Crusades, such as <i>Antioche</i>, and
some which are not connected with any existing cycle, such as
<i>Ciperis de Vignevaux</i>; most of this last category, however, are
works of the decadence.</p>

<p>The analysis which is here sketched is founded on the latest
theories of Léon Gautier, who has given the labour of a lifetime
to the investigation of this subject. The wealth of material is
baffling to the ordinary student; of the medieval chansons de
geste many hundreds of thousands of lines have been preserved.
The habit of composing became in the 14th century, as has been
said, no longer an art but a monomania. Needless to add that
a very large proportion of the surviving poems have never yet
been published. All the best of the early chansons de geste are
written in ten-syllable verse, divided into stanzas or <i>laisses</i> of
different length, united by a single assonance. Rhyme came
in with the 13th century, and had the effect in languid bards of
weakening the narrative; the sing-song of it led at last to the
abandonment of verse in favour of plain historical prose. The
general character of the chansons de geste, especially of those
of the 12th century, is hard, coarse, inflexible, like the march
of rough men stiffened by coats of mail. There is no art and
little grace, but a magnificent display of force. These poems
enshrine the self-sufficiency of a young and powerful people;
they are full of Gallic pride, they breathe the spirit of an indomitable
warlike energy. All their figures belong to the same
social order of things, and all illustrate the same fighting
aristocracy. The moving principle is that of chivalry, and what
is presented is, invariably, the spectacle of the processional life
of a medieval soldier. The age described is a disturbed one;
the feudal anarchy of Europe is united, for a moment, in defending
western civilization against the inroads of Asia, against &ldquo;the
yellow peril.&rdquo; But it is a time of transition in Europe also, and
Charlemagne, the immortal but enfeebled emperor, whose beard
is whiter than lilies, represents an old order of things against
which the rude barons of the North are perpetually in successful
revolt. The loud cry of the dying Ronald, as E. Quinet said,
rings through the whole poetical literature of medieval France;
it is the voice of the individuality of the great vassal, who, in
the decay of the empire, stands alone with himself and with
his sword.</p>

the second part of the verse. In the English chant the &ldquo;intonation&rdquo;

lies about 12 m. from the sea on a river which is navigable for
boats and inside the bar of which there is good anchorage for
light-draft vessels. The trade is chiefly in rubies and sapphires
from the mines of the Krat and Pailin districts, and in pepper,
of which about 500 tons are exported annually. Cardamoms
and rosewood are also exported. In 1905 Chantabun was made
the headquarters of a high commissioner with jurisdiction extending
over the coast districts from the Nam Wen on the East
to Cape Liant on the West, which were thus united to form a
provincial division (<i>Monton</i>). In 1893 Chantabun was occupied
by a French force of four hundred men, a step taken by France
as a guarantee for the execution by Siam of undertakings entered
into by the treaty of that year. The occupation, which was
merely military and did not affect the civil government, lasted
until January 1905, when, in accordance with the provisions of
the Franco-Siamese treaty of 1904, the garrison of occupation
was withdrawn. Chantabun has been since the 17th century,
and still is, a stronghold of the Roman Catholic missionaries,
and the Christian element amongst the population is greater
here than anywhere else in Siam.</p>

depression and a thick lobed irregular margin. Running down
into the stem from the cap are a number of shallow thick gills.
The substance of the fungus is dry and opaque with a peculiar
smell suggesting ripe apricots or plums. The flesh is whitish
tinged with yellow. The chantarelle is sold in the markets on
the continent of Europe, where it forms a regular article of food,
but seems little known in Britain though often plentiful in the

<p><span class="bold">CHANTILLY,<a name="ar179" id="ar179"></a></span> a town of northern France, in the department of
Oise, 25 m. N. of Paris on the Northern railway to St Quentin.
Pop. (1906) 4632. It is finely situated to the north of the forest
of Chantilly and on the left bank of the river Nonette, and is one
of the favourite Parisian resorts. Its name was long associated
with the manufacture, which has now to a great extent decayed,
of lace and blonde; it is still more celebrated for its château and
its park (laid out originally by A. Le Nôtre in the second half of
the 17th century), and as the scene of the great annual races of
the French Jockey Club. The château consists of the palace
built from 1876 to 1885 and of an older portion adjoining it
known as the châtelet. The old castle must have been in existence
in the 13th century, and in the reign of Charles VI. the lordship
belonged to Pierre d&rsquo;Orgemont, chancellor of France. In 1484
it passed to the house of Montmorency, and in 1632 from
that family to the house of Condé. Louis II., prince de Condé,
surnamed the Great, was specially attached to the place, and did
a great deal to enhance its beauty and splendour. Here he
enjoyed the society of La Bruyère, Racine, Molière, La Fontaine,
Boileau, and other great men of his time; and here his steward
Vatel killed himself in despair, because of a hitch in the preparations
for the reception of Louis XIV. The stables close to the
racecourse were built from 1719 to 1735 by Louis-Henri, duke
of Bourbon. Of the two splendid mansions existing at that period
known as the grand château and the châtelet, the former was
destroyed about the time of the Revolution, but the latter,
built for Anne de Montmorency by Jean Bullant, still remains
as one of the finest specimens of Renaissance architecture in
France. The château d&rsquo;Enghien, facing the entrance to the
grand château, was built in 1770 as a guest-house. On the death
in 1830 of the duke of Bourbon, the last representative of the
house of Condé, the estate passed into the hands of Henri, duc
d&rsquo;Aumale, fourth son of Louis Philippe. In 1852 the house of
Orleans was declared incapable of possessing property in France,
and Chantilly was accordingly sold by auction. Purchased by
the English bankers, Coutts &amp; Co., it passed back into the hands
of the duc d&rsquo;Aumale, in 1872. By him a magnificent palace,
including a fine chapel in the Renaissance style, was erected on
the foundations of the ancient grand château and in the style
of the châtelet. It is quadrilateral in shape, consisting of four
unequal sides flanked by towers and built round a courtyard.
The whole group of buildings as well as the pleasure-ground
behind them, known as the Parterre de la Volière, is surrounded
by fosses supplied with water from the Nonette. On the terrace
in front of the château there is a bronze statue of the constable
Anne de Montmorency. The duc d&rsquo;Aumale installed in the
châtelet a valuable library, specially rich in incunabula and 16th
century editions of classic authors, and a collection of the paintings
of the great masters, besides many other objects of art.
By a public act in 1886 he gave the park and château with its
superb collections to the Institute of France in trust for the
nation, reserving to himself only a life interest; and when he
died in 1897 the Institute acquired full possession.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHANTREY, SIR FRANCIS LEGATT<a name="ar180" id="ar180"></a></span> (1782-1841), English
sculptor, was born on the 7th of April 1782 at Norton near
Sheffield, where his father, a carpenter, cultivated a small farm.
His father died when he was eight years of age; and his mother
having married again, his profession was left to be chosen by his
friends. In his sixteenth year he was on the point of being
apprenticed to a grocer in Sheffield, when, having seen some
wood-carving in a shop-window, he requested to be made a carver
instead, and was accordingly placed with a Mr Ramsey, wood-carver
in Sheffield. In this situation he became acquainted with
Raphael Smith, a distinguished draftsman in crayon, who gave
him lessons in painting; and Chantrey, eager to commence his
course as an artist, procured the cancelling of his indentures, and
went to try his fortune in Dublin and Edinburgh, and finally
(1802) in London. Here he first obtained employment as an
assistant wood-carver, but at the same time devoted himself
to portrait-painting, bust-sculpture, and modelling in clay. He
exhibited pictures at the Academy for some years from 1804,
but from 1807 onwards devoted himself mainly to sculpture.
The sculptor Nollekens showed particular zeal in recognizing
his merits. In 1807 he married his cousin, Miss Wale, who had
some property of her own. His first imaginative work in sculpture
was the model of the head of Satan, which was exhibited at the
Royal Academy in 1808. He afterwards executed for Greenwich
hospital four colossal busts of the admirals Duncan, Howe,
Vincent and Nelson; and so rapidly did his reputation spread
that the next bust which he executed, that of Horne Tooke,
procured him commissions to the extent of £12,000. From this
period he was almost uninterruptedly engaged in professional
labour. In 1819 he visited Italy, and became acquainted with
the most distinguished sculptors of Florence and Rome. He was
chosen an associate (1815) and afterwards a member (1818)
of the Royal Academy, received the degree of M.A. from
Cambridge, and that of D.C.L. from Oxford, and in 1835
was knighted. He died after an illness of only two hours&rsquo;
duration on the 25th of November 1841, having for some years
suffered from disease of the heart, and was buried in a tomb
constructed by himself in the church of his native village.</p>

<p>The works of Chantrey are extremely numerous. The principal
are the statues of Washington in the State-house at Boston,
U.S.A.; of George III. in the Guildhall, London; of George IV.
at Brighton; of Pitt in Hanover Square, London; of James
Watt in Westminster Abbey and in Glasgow; of Roscoe and
Canning in Liverpool; of Dalton in Manchester; of Lord
President Blair and Lord Melville in Edinburgh, &amp;c. Of his equestrian
statues the most famous are those of Sir Thomas Munro
in Calcutta, and the duke of Wellington in front of the London
Exchange. But the finest of Chantrey&rsquo;s works are his busts,
and his delineations of children. The figures of two children
asleep in each other&rsquo;s arms, which form a monumental design in
Lichfield cathedral, have always been lauded for beauty, simplicity
and grace. So is also the statue of the girlish Lady Louisa
Russell, represented as standing on tiptoe and fondling a dove
in her bosom. Both these works appear, in design, to have
owed something to Stothard; for Chantrey knew his own
scantiness of ideal invention or composition, and on system
sought aid from others for such attempts. In busts, his leading
excellence is facility&mdash;a ready unconstrained air of life, a prompt
vivacity of ordinary expression. Allan Cunningham and Weekes
were his chief assistants, and were indeed the active executants
of many works that pass under Chantrey&rsquo;s name. Chantrey
was a man of warm and genial temperament, and is said to have
borne noticeable though commonplace resemblance to the
usual portraits of Shakespeare.</p>

<p><i>Chantrey Bequest.</i>&mdash;By the will dated the 31st of December
1840, Chantrey (who had no children) left his whole residuary
personal estate after the decease or on the second marriage of his
widow (less certain specified annuities and bequests) in trust for
the president and trustees of the Royal Academy (or in the event
of the dissolution of the Royal Academy, to such society as might
take its place), the income to be devoted to the encouragement of
British fine art in painting and sculpture only, by &ldquo;the purchase
of works of fine art of the highest merit ... that can be obtained.&rdquo;
The funds might be allowed to accumulate for not more than five
years; works by British or foreign artists, dead or living, might be
acquired, so long as such works were entirely executed within the
shores of Great Britain, the artists having been in residence there
during such execution and completion. The prices to be paid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page848" id="page848"></a>848</span>
were to be &ldquo;liberal,&rdquo; and no sympathy for an artist or his family
was to influence the selection or the purchase of works, which
were to be acquired solely on the ground of intrinsic merit. No
commission or orders might be given: the works must be finished
before purchase. Conditions were made as to the exhibition of
the works, in the confident expectation that as the intention of
the testator was to form and establish a &ldquo;public collection of
British Fine Art in Painting and Sculpture,&rdquo; the government or
the country would provide a suitable gallery for their display;
and an annual sum of £300 and £50 was to be paid to the president
of the Royal Academy and the secretary respectively, for the
discharge of their duties in carrying out the provisions of the
will.</p>

<p>Lady Chantrey died in 1875, and two years later the fund
became available for the purchase of paintings and sculptures.
The capital sum available amounted to £105,000 in 3% Consols,
which (since reduced to 2½%) produces an available annual
income varying from £2500 to £2100. Galleries in the Victoria
and Albert Museum at South Kensington were at first adopted
as the depository of the works acquired, until in 1898 the Royal
Academy arranged with the treasury, on behalf of the government,
for the transference of the collection to the National
Gallery of British Art, which had been erected by Sir Henry
Tate at Millbank. It was agreed that the &ldquo;Tate Gallery&rdquo; should
be its future home, and that &ldquo;no power of selection or elimination
is claimed on behalf of the trustees and director of the National
Gallery&rdquo; (Treasury Letter, 18054-98, 7th December 1898) in
respect of the pictures and sculptures which were then to be
handed over and which should, from time to time, be sent to
augment the collection. Inasmuch as it was felt that the provision
that all works must be complete to be eligible for purchase
militated against the most advantageous disposition of the fund
in respect of sculpture, in the case of wax models or plaster casts
before being converted into marble or bronze, it was sought in
the action of <i>Sir F. Leighton</i> v. <i>Hughes</i> (tried by Mr Justice
North, judgment May 7th, 1888, and in the court of appeal,
before the master of the rolls, Lord Justice Cotton, and Lord
Justice Fry, judgment June 4th, 1889&mdash;the master of the rolls
dissenting) to allow of sculptors being commissioned to complete
in bronze or marble a work executed in wax or plaster, such
&ldquo;completion&rdquo; being more or less a mechanical process. The
attempt, however, was abortive.</p>

<p>A growing discontent with the interpretation put by the
Royal Academy upon the terms of the will as shown in the works
acquired began to find expression more than usually forcible and
lively in the press during the year 1903, and a debate raised in the
House of Lords by the earl of Lytton led to the appointment of a
select committee of the House of Lords, which sat from June to
August 1904. The committee consisted of the earls of Carlisle,
Lytton, and Crewe, and Lords Windsor, Ribblesdale, Newton,
and Killanin, and the witnesses represented the Royal Academy
and representative art institutions and art critics. The report
(ordered to be printed on the 8th of August 1904) made certain
recommendations with a view to the prevention of certain former
errors of administration held to have been sustained, but dismissed
other charges against the Academy. In reply thereto a
memorandum was issued by the Royal Academy (February
1905, ordered to be printed on the 7th of August 1905&mdash;Paper
166) disagreeing with certain recommendations, but allowing
others, either intact or in a modified form.</p>

<p>Up to 1905 inclusive 203 works had been bought&mdash;all except
two from living painters&mdash;at a cost of nearly £68,000. Of these,
175 were in oil-colours, 12 in water-colours, and 16 sculptures
(10 in bronze and 6 marble).</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHANT ROYAL,<a name="ar181" id="ar181"></a></span> one of the fixed forms of verse invented by
the ingenuity of the poets of medieval France. It is composed
of five strophes, identical in arrangement, of eleven verses each,
and of an envoi of five verses. All the strophes are written on the
five rhymes exhibited in the first strophe, the entire poem,
therefore, consisting of sixty lines in the course of which five
rhymes are repeated. It has been conjectured that the chant
royal is an extended ballade, or rather a ballade conceived upon a
larger scale; but which form preceded the other appears to be
uncertain. On this point Henri de Croï, who wrote about these
forms of verse in his <i>Art et science de rhétorique</i> (1493), throws no
light. He dwells, however, on the great dignity of what he calls
the &ldquo;Champt Royal,&rdquo; and says that those who defy with success
the ardour of its rules deserve crowns and garlands for their
pains. Étienne Pasquier (1529-1615) points out the fact that the
Chant Royal, by its length and the rigidity of its structure, is
better fitted than the ballade for solemn and pompous themes.
In Old French, the most admired chants royal are those of Clement
Marot; his <i>Chant royal chrestien</i>, with its refrain</p>

<p class="center">&ldquo;Santé au corps, et Paradis à l&rsquo;âme,&rdquo;</p>

<p class="noind">was celebrated. Théodore de Banville defines the chant royal as
essentially belonging to ages of faith, when its subjects could be
either the exploits of a hero of royal race or the processional
splendours of religion. La Fontaine was the latest of the French
poets to attempt the chant royal, until it was resuscitated in
modern times.</p>

<p>This species of poem was unknown in English medieval literature
and was only introduced into Great Britain in the last
quarter of the 19th century. The earliest chant royal in English
was that published by Edmund Gosse in 1877; it is here
given to exemplify the structure and rhyme-arrangement of the
form:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the middle ages the chant royal was largely used for the
praise of the Virgin Mary. Eustache Deschamps (1340-1410)
distinguishes these Marian chants royaux, which were called
&ldquo;serventois,&rdquo; by the absence of an envoi. These poems are first
mentioned by Rutebeuf, a <i>trouvère</i> of the 13th century. The
chant royal is practically unknown outside French and English
literature.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHANTRY<a name="ar182" id="ar182"></a></span> (Fr. <i>chanterie</i>, from <i>chanter</i>, to sing; Med. Lat. <i>cantuaria</i>),
a small chapel built out from a church, endowed in pre-Reformation
times for the express purpose of maintaining priests
for the chanting of masses for the soul of the founder or of some one
named by him. It generally contained the tomb of the founder,
and, as the officiator or mass-priest was often unconnected with
the parochial clergy, had an entrance from the outside. The
word passed through graduations of meaning. Its first sense was
singing or chanting. Then it meant the endowment funds, next
the priests, and then the church or chapel itself.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHANUTE,<a name="ar183" id="ar183"></a></span> a city of Neosho county, Kansas, U.S.A., 1 m.
from the Neosho river, and about 120 m. S.S.W. of Kansas city.
Pop. (1890) 2826; (1900) 4208, of whom 210 were foreign-born
and 171 were negroes; (1910 census) 9272. Chanute is served
by the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe and the Missouri, Kansas
&amp; Texas railways, the former having large repair shops. The
city is in the Kansas-Oklahoma oil and gas field, and is
surrounded by a fine farming and dairying region, in which
special attention is given to the raising of small fruit; oil, gas,
cement rock and brick shale are found in the vicinity. Among
the city&rsquo;s manufactures are refined oil, Portland cement, vitrified
brick and tile, glass, asphalt, ice, cigars, drilling machinery, and
flour. The municipality owns and operates the waterworks,
a natural gas plant, and an electric lighting plant. Four towns&mdash;
New Chicago, Tioga, Chicago Junction and Alliance&mdash;were
started here about the same time (1870). In 1872 they were
consolidated, and the present name was adopted in honour of
Octave Chanute (b. 1832), the civil engineer and aeronautist
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Flight and Flying</a></span>), then the engineer of the Lawrence,
Leavenworth &amp; Galveston railway (now part of the Atchison
system). Chanute was incorporated as a city of the third class
in 1873, and its charter was revised in 1888. Natural gas and
oil were found here in 1899, and Chanute became one of the
leaders of the Kansas independent refineries in their contest
with the Standard Oil Company.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHANZY, ANTOINE EUGÈNE ALFRED<a name="ar184" id="ar184"></a></span> (1823-1883), French
general, was born at Nouart (Ardennes) on the 18th of March
1823. The son of a cavalry officer, he was educated at the naval
school at Brest, but enlisted in the artillery, and, subsequently
passing through St Cyr, was commissioned in the Zouaves in
1843. He saw a good deal of fighting in Algeria, and was promoted
lieutenant in 1848, and captain in 1851. He became
<i>chef de bataillon</i> in 1856, and served in the Lombardy campaign
of 1859, being present at Magenta and Solferino. He took part
in the Syrian campaign of 1860-61 as a lieutenant-colonel; and
as colonel commanded the 48th regiment at Rome in 1864.
He returned to Algeria as general of brigade, assisted to quell
the Arab insurrection, and commanded the subdivisions of Bel
Abbes and Tlemçen in 1868. Although he had acquired a good
professional reputation, he was in bad odour at the war office
on account of suspected contributions to the press, and at the
outbreak of the Franco-German War he was curtly refused a
brigade command. After the revolution, however, the government
of national defence called him from Algeria, made him
a general of division, and gave him command of the XVI. corps
of the army of the Loire. (For the operations of the Orleans
campaign which followed, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Franco-German War</a></span>.) The
Loire army won the greatest success of the French during the
whole war at Coulmiers, and followed this up with another
victorious action at Patay; in both engagements General
Chanzy&rsquo;s corps took the most brilliant part. After the second
battle of Orleans and the separation of the two wings of the
French army, Chanzy was appointed to command that in the
west, designated the second army of the Loire. His enemies,
the grand duke of Mecklenburg, Prince Frederick Charles, and
General von der Tann, all regarded Chanzy as their most formidable
opponent. He displayed conspicuous moral courage
and constancy, not less than technical skill, in the fighting from
Beaugency to the Loire, in his retreat to Le Mans, and in
retiring to Laval behind the Mayenne. As Gambetta was
the soul, Chanzy was the strong right arm of French resistance
to the invader. He was made a grand officer of the Legion of
Honour, and was elected to the National Assembly. At the
outbreak of the Commune, Chanzy, then at Paris, fell into the
hands of the insurgents, by whom he was forced to give his
parole not to serve against them. It was said that he would
otherwise have been appointed instead of MacMahon to command
the army of Versailles. A ransom of £40,000 was also paid by
the government for him. In 1872 he became a member of the
committee of defence and commander of the VII. army corps,
and in 1873 was appointed governor of Algeria, where he remained
for six years. In 1875 he was elected a life senator, in
1878 received the grand cross of the Legion of Honour, and in
1879, without his consent, was nominated for the presidency of
the republic, receiving a third of the total votes. For two years
he was ambassador at St Petersburg, during which time he
received many tokens of respect, not only from the Russians,
but also from the German emperor, William I., and Prince
Bismarck. He died suddenly, while commanding the VI. army
corps (stationed nearest to the German frontier), at Châlons-sur-Marne,
on the 4th of January 1883, only a few days after Gambetta,
and his remains received a state funeral. He was the
author of <i>La Deuxième Armée de la Loire</i> (1872). Statues of
General Chanzy have been erected at Nouart and Le Mans.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAOS,<a name="ar185" id="ar185"></a></span> in the Hesiodic theogony, the infinite empty space,
which existed before all things (<i>Theog.</i> 116, 123). It is not,
however, a mere abstraction, being filled with clouds and darkness;
from it proceed Erebus and Nyx (Night), whose children
are Aether (upper air) and Hemera (Day). In the Orphic
cosmogony the origin of all goes back to Chronos, the personification
of time, who produces Aether and Chaos. In the Aristophanic
parody (<i>Birds</i>, 691) the winged Eros in conjunction with
gloomy Chaos brings forth the race of birds. The later Roman
conception (Ovid, <i>Metam.</i> i. 7) makes Chaos the original
undigested, amorphous mass, into which the architect of the
world introduces order and harmony, and from which individual
forms are created. In the created world (cosmos, order of the
universe) the word has various meanings:&mdash;the universe;
the space between heaven and earth; the under-world and its
ruler. Metaphorically it is used for the immeasurable darkness,
eternity, and the infinite generally. In modern usage &ldquo;chaos&rdquo;
denotes a state of disorder and confusion.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHAPBOOK<a name="ar186" id="ar186"></a></span> (from the O. Eng. <i>chap</i>, to buy and sell), the
comparatively modern name applied by booksellers and bibliophiles
to the little stitched tracts written for the common people
and formerly circulated in England, Scotland and the American
colonies by itinerant dealers or chapmen, consisting chiefly of
vulgarized versions of popular stories, such as <i>Tom Thumb</i>,
<i>Jack the Giant Killer</i>, <i>Mother Shipton</i>, and <i>Reynard the
Fox</i>&mdash;travels, biographies and religious treatises. Few of the older
chapbooks exist. Samuel Pepys collected some of the best and
had them bound into small quarto volumes, which he called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page850" id="page850"></a>850</span>
Vulgaria; also four volumes of a smaller size, which he lettered
<i>Penny Witticisms, Penny Merriments, Penny Compliments</i> and
<i>Penny Godlinesses</i>. The early chapbooks were the direct
descendants of the black-letter tracts of Wynkyn de Worde. It
was in France that the printing-press first began to supply
reading for the common people. At the end of the 15th century
there was a large popular literature of farces, tales in verse and
prose, satires, almanacs, &amp;c., stitched together so as to contain
a few leaves, and circulated by itinerant booksellers, known as
colporteurs. Most early English chapbooks are adaptations or
translations of these French originals, and were introduced into
England early in the 16th century. The chapbooks of the 17th
century present us with valuable illustrations of the manners
of the time; one of the best known is that containing the story
of Dick Whittington. Others which had a great vogue are <i>Jack
the Giant Killer, Little Red Riding Hood</i>, and <i>Mother Shipton</i>.
Those of the 18th century are far inferior in every way, both as
regards the literature and the printing; and unfortunately it
is these which form the bulk of what is now known to us in
collections as chapbooks. They have never exercised any great
influence in England nor received much attention, owing no
doubt to their poor literary character. In France, on the other
hand, their French equivalents have been the object of close and
systematic study, and <i>L&rsquo;Histoire des livres populaires ou de la
littérature du colportage</i> by Charles Nisard (1854) goes deeply into
the subject. Amongst English books may be mentioned <i>Notices
of Fugitive Tracts and Chapbooks</i>, by J.O. Halliwell-Phillipps
(1849); <i>Chapbooks of the 18th Century</i>, by John Ashton (1882),
and some reprints by the Villon Society in 1885. The word &ldquo;chapbook&rdquo;
has not been noticed earlier than 1824, when Dibdin, the
celebrated bibliographer, described a work as being &ldquo;a chapbook,
printed in rather a neat black-letter.&rdquo;</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHAPE<a name="ar187" id="ar187"></a></span> (from the Fr. <i>chape</i>, a hood, cope or sheath), a cover
or metal plate, such as the cap upon the needle in the compass,
also the transverse guard of a sword which protects the hand.
From the original meaning comes the use of the word as a support
or catch to attach one thing to another, as the hook on a belt
to which the sword is fastened. The word is also used for the tip
of a fox&rsquo;s brush.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHAPEL,<a name="ar188" id="ar188"></a></span> a place of religious worship,<a name="fa1g" id="fa1g" href="#ft1g"><span class="sp">1</span></a> a name properly applied
to that of a Christian religious body, but sometimes to any small
temple of pagan worship (Lat. <i>sacellum</i>). The word is derived
through the O. Fr. <i>chapele</i>, modern <i>chapelle</i>, from the Late Lat.
<i>capelle</i> or <i>cappella</i>, diminutive of <i>cappa</i>, a cape, particularly that
of a monk. This word was transferred to any sanctuary containing
relics, in the early history of the Frankish Church,
because the cloak of St Martin, <i>cappa brevior Sancti Martini</i>,
one of the most sacred relics of the Frankish kings, was carried
in a sanctuary or shrine wherever the king went; and oaths were
taken on it (see Ducange, <i>Glossarium</i>, <i>s.v.</i> <i>Capella</i>). Such a
sanctuary was served by a priest, who was hence called <i>capellanus</i>,
from which is derived the English &ldquo;chaplain&rdquo; (<i>q.v.</i>). The strict
application of the word to a sanctuary containing relics was
extended to embrace any place of worship other than a church,
and it was synonymous, therefore, with &ldquo;oratory&rdquo; (<i>oratorium</i>),
especially one attached to a palace or to a private dwelling-house.
The celebrated Sainte Chapelle in Paris, attached to what is now
the Palais de Justice, well illustrates the early and proper meaning
of the word. It was built (consecration, 1248) by St Louis
of France to contain the relic of the Crown of Thorns, ransomed
by the king from the Venetians, who held it in pawn from the
Latin emperor of the East, John of Brienne, lately dead. The
chapel served as the sanctuary of the relic lodged in the
upper chapel, and the whole building was attached as the place
of worship to the king&rsquo;s palace. This, the primary meaning,
survives in the chapels usually placed in the aisles of cathedrals
and large churches. They were originally built either to contain
relics of a particular saint to whom they were dedicated, or
the tomb of a particular family.</p>

<p>In the Church of England the word is applied to a private
place of worship, attached either to the palaces of the sovereign,
&ldquo;chapels royal,&rdquo; or to the residence of a private person, to a
college, school, prison, workhouse, &amp;c. Further, the word has
particular legal applications, though in each case the building
might be and often is styled a church. These are places of
worship supplementary to a parish church, and may be either
&ldquo;chapels of ease,&rdquo; to ease or relieve the mother-church and serve
those parishioners who may live far away, &ldquo;parochial chapels,&rdquo;
the &ldquo;churches&rdquo; of ancient divisions of a very large and widely
scattered parish, or &ldquo;district chapels,&rdquo; those of a district of a
parish divided under the various church building acts. A &ldquo;free
chapel&rdquo; is one founded by the king and by his authority, and
visited by him and not by the bishop. A &ldquo;proprietary chapel&rdquo;
is one that belongs to a private person. They are anomalies
to the English ecclesiastical law, have no parish rights, and can
be converted to other than religious purposes, but a clergyman
may be licensed to perform duty in such a place of worship. In
the early and middle part of the 19th century such proprietary
chapels were common, but they have practically ceased to exist.
&ldquo;Chapel&rdquo; was early and still is in England the general name of
places of worship other than those of the established Church,
but the application of &ldquo;church&rdquo; to all places of worship without
distinction of sect is becoming more and more common. The
word &ldquo;chapel&rdquo; was in this restricted sense first applied to places
of worship belonging to the Roman Church in England, and was
thus restricted to those attached to foreign embassies, or to those
of the consorts of Charles I. and II. and James II., who were
members of that church. The word is still frequently the general
term for Roman Catholic churches in Great Britain and always
so in Ireland. The use of &ldquo;chapel&rdquo; as a common term for all
Nonconformist places of worship was general through most of the
19th century, so that &ldquo;church and chapel&rdquo; was the usual phrase
to mark the distinction between members of the established
Church and those of Nonconformist bodies. Here the widened
use of &ldquo;church&rdquo; noticed above has been especially marked.
Most of the recent buildings for worship erected by Nonconformist
bodies will be found to be styled Wesleyan, Congregational,
&amp;c., churches. It would appear that while the word
&ldquo;chapel&rdquo; was not infrequent in the early history of Nonconformity,
&ldquo;meeting-house&rdquo; was the more usual term.</p>

<p>From the architectural point of view the addition of chapels
to a cathedral or large church assumes some historical importance
in consequence of the changes it involved in the plan. It was
the introduction of the apsidal chapels in the churches of France
which eventually led to the <i>chevet</i> or cluster of eastern chapels
in many of the great cathedrals, and also sometimes to the
extension of the transept so as to include additional apsidal
chapels on the east side. In France, and to a certain extent in
Italy, the multiplication of chapels led to their being placed on
the north and south side of the aisles, and in some cases, as at
Albi in France, to the suppression of the aisles and the instalment
of the chapels in their place. The chapels of the colleges at
Oxford and Cambridge are sometimes of large dimensions and
architecturally of great importance, that of Christ Church being
actually the cathedral of Oxford; among others may be mentioned
the chapel of Merton College, and the new chapel of Exeter
College, both in Oxford, and the chapel of King&rsquo;s College,
Cambridge, which is roofed over with perhaps the finest fan-vault
in England. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Vault</a></span>, Plate II., fig. 19.)</p>

<hr class="foot" /> <div class="note">

<p><a name="ft1g" id="ft1g" href="#fa1g"><span class="fn">1</span></a> The only other English sense is that of a printer&rsquo;s workshop, or
the body of compositors in it, who are presided over by a &ldquo;father

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHAPELAIN, JEAN<a name="ar189" id="ar189"></a></span> (1595-1674), French poet and man of
letters, the son of a notary, was born in Paris on the 4th of
December 1595. His father destined him for his own profession;
but his mother, who had known Ronsard, had determined
otherwise. At an early age Chapelain began to qualify himself
for literature, learning, under Nicolas Bourbon, Greek and Latin,
and teaching himself Italian and Spanish. Having finished his
studies, he was engaged for a while in teaching Spanish to a
young nobleman. He was then appointed tutor to the two sons
of a M. de la Trousse, grand provost of France. Attached for
the next seventeen years to the family of this gentleman, the
administration of whose fortune was wholly in his hands, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page851" id="page851"></a>851</span>
seems to have published nothing during this period, yet to have
acquired a great reputation as a probability. His first work
given to the public was a preface for the <i>Adone</i> of Marini, who
printed and published that notorious poem at Paris. This was
followed by an excellent translation of Mateo Aleman&rsquo;s novel,
<i>Guzmán de Alfarache</i>, and by four extremely indifferent odes,
one of them addressed to Richelieu. The credit of introducing
the law of the dramatic unities into French literature has been
claimed for many writers, and especially for the Abbé d&rsquo;Aubignac,
whose <i>Pratique du théâtre</i> appeared in 1657. The theory had
of course been enunciated in the <i>Art poétique</i> of J.C. Scaliger
in 1561, and subsequently by other writers, but there is no doubt
that it was the action of Chapelain that transferred it from the
region of theory to that of actual practice. In a conversation
with Richelieu in about 1632, reported by the abbé d&rsquo;Olivet,
Chapelain maintained that it was indispensable to maintain the
unities of time, place and action, and it is explicitly stated that
the doctrine was new to the cardinal and to the poets who were
in his pay. French classical drama thus owes the riveting of its
fetters to Chapelain. Rewarded with a pension of a thousand
crowns, and from the first an active member of the newly-constituted
Academy, Chapelain drew up the plan of the grammar
and dictionary the compilation of which was to be a principal
function of the young institution, and at Richelieu&rsquo;s command
drew up the <i>Sentiments de l&rsquo;Académie sur le Cid</i>. In 1656 he
published, in a magnificent form, the first twelve cantos of his
celebrated epic <i>La Pucelle</i>,<a name="fa1h" id="fa1h" href="#ft1h"><span class="sp">1</span></a> on which he had been engaged during
twenty years. Six editions of the poem were disposed of in
eighteen months. But this was the end of the poetic reputation
of Chapelain, &ldquo;the legist of Parnassus&rdquo;. Later the slashing
satire of Boileau (in this case fairly master of his subject) did
its work, and Chapelain (&ldquo;<i>Le plus grand poète Français qu&rsquo; ait
jamais été et du plus solide jugement</i>,&rdquo; as he is called in Colbert&rsquo;s
list) took his place among the failures of modern art.</p>

<p>Chapelain&rsquo;s reputation as a critic survived this catastrophe,
and in 1663 he was employed by Colbert to draw up an account
of contemporary men of letters, destined to guide the king in
his distribution of pensions. In this pamphlet, as in his letters,
he shows to far greater advantage than in his unfortunate epic.
His prose is incomparably better than his verse; his criticisms
are remarkable for their justice and generosity; his erudition
and kindliness of heart are everywhere apparent; the royal
attention is directed alike towards the author&rsquo;s firmest friends
and bitterest enemies. To him young Racine was indebted
not only for kindly and seasonable counsel, but also for that
pension of six hundred livres which was so useful to him. The
catholicity of his taste is shown by his <i>De la lecture des vieux
romans</i> (pr. 1870), in which he praises the <i>chansons de geste</i>,
forgotten by his generation. Chapelain refused many honours,
and his disinterestedness in this and other cases makes it necessary
to receive with caution the stories of Ménage and Tallemant des
Réaux, who assert that he was in his old age a miser, and that
a considerable fortune was found hoarded in his apartments
when he died on the 22nd of February 1674.</p>

<p>There is a very favourable estimate of Chapelain&rsquo;s merits as a
critic in George Saintsbury&rsquo;s <i>History of Criticism</i>, ii. 256-261.

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHAPLAIN,<a name="ar194" id="ar194"></a></span> strictly one who conducts service in a chapel
(<i>q.v.</i>), <i>i.e.</i> a priest or minister without parochial charge who is
attached for special duties to a sovereign or his representatives
(ambassadors, judges, &amp;c.), to bishops, to the establishments of
nobles, &amp;c., to institutions (<i>e.g.</i> parliament, congress, colleges,
schools, workhouses, cemeteries), or to the army and the navy.
In some cases a parish priest is also appointed to a chaplaincy,
but in so far as he is a chaplain he has no parochial duties. Thus
a bishop of the English Church appoints examining chaplains
who conduct the examination of candidates for holy orders;
such officials generally hold ordinary benefices also. The British
sovereign has 36 &ldquo;Chaplains in Ordinary,&rdquo; who perform service
at St James&rsquo;s in rotation, as well as &ldquo;Honorary Chaplains&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Chaplains of the Household.&rdquo; There are also royal chaplains
in Scotland and Ireland. The Scottish chaplains in ordinary
are on the same basis as those in England, but the Irish chaplains
are attached to the household of the lord-lieutenant. The Indian
civil service appoints a number of clergymen of the Church of
England and the Church of Scotland. These clergymen are
known as Chaplains, and are subject to the same conditions as
other civil servants, being eligible for a retiring pension after 23
years of service. Chaplains are also appointed under the foreign
office to embassies, legations, consulates, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Workhouse chaplains are appointed by overseers and guardians
on the direction of the Local Government Board, to which alone
such chaplains are responsible. Prison chaplains are appointed
by the home secretary.</p>

<p>In the British army there are two kinds of chaplains, permanent
and occasional. The former, described as Chaplains to the Forces,
hold commissions, serving throughout the empire except in
India: they include a Chaplain-General who ranks as a major-general,
and four classes of subordinate chaplains who rank
respectively as colonels, lieutenant-colonels, majors and captains.
There are about 100 in all. Special chaplains (Acting Chaplains
for Temporary Service) may be appointed by a secretary of state
under the Army Chaplains Act of 1868 to perform religious
service for the army in particular districts. The permanent
chaplains may be Church of England, Roman Catholic, or
Presbyterian; Wesleyans (if they prefer not to accept commissions)
may be appointed Acting Chaplains. The Church of
England chaplains report to the chaplain-general, while other
chaplains report to the War Office direct. In the navy, chaplains
are likewise appointed but do not hold official rank. They must
have a special ecclesiastical licence from the archbishop of
Canterbury. In 1900 a Chaplains&rsquo; Department of the Territorial
Force was formed; there is no denominational restriction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page852" id="page852"></a>852</span></p>

<p>In the armies and navies of all Christian countries chaplains
are officially appointed, with the single exception of France,
where the office was abolished on the separation of Church and
State. In the army of the United States of America chaplains
are originally appointed by the president, and subsequently are
under the authority of the secretary of war, who receives recommendations
as regards transfer from department commanders.
By act of Congress, approved in April 1904, the establishment of
chaplains was fixed at 57 (15 with the rank of major), 12 for the
artillery corps and 1 each for the cavalry and infantry regiments.
There is no distinction of sect. In the U.S. navy the chaplains
are 24 in number, of whom 13 rank as lieutenants, 7 as commanders,
4 as captains.</p>

<p>In the armies of Roman Catholic countries there are elaborate
regulations. Where the chaplains are numerous a chaplain-major
is generally appointed, but in the absence of special sanction
from the pope such officer has no spiritual jurisdiction. Moreover,
chaplains must be approved by the ordinary of the locality. In
Austria there are Roman Catholic, Greek Church, Jewish and
Mahommedan chaplains. The Roman Catholic chaplains are
classed as parish priests, curates and assistants, and are subject
to an army Vicar Apostolic. In war, at an army headquarters
there are a &ldquo;field-rabbi,&rdquo; a &ldquo;military imam,&rdquo; an evangelical
minister, as well as the Roman Catholic hierarchy. By a decree
of the Sacred Congregation of Propaganda (May 15, 1906), the
archbishop of Westminster is the ecclesiastical superior of all
commissioned Roman Catholic chaplains in the British army and
navy, and he is empowered to negotiate with the civil authorities
concerning appointments.</p>

<p>In Germany, owing to the fact that there are different religions
in the different states, there is no uniform system. In Prussia
there are two <i>Feldprobste</i> (who are directly under the war
minister), one Lutheran, one Roman Catholic. The latter is a
titular bishop, and has sole spiritual authority over soldiers.
There are also army corps and divisional chaplains of both
faiths. Bavaria and Saxony, both Roman Catholic states, have
no special spiritual hierarchy; in Bavaria, the archbishop of
Munich and Freysing is <i>ex officio</i> bishop of the army.</p>

<p>The origin of the office of <i>capellanus</i> or <i>cappellanus</i> in the
medieval church is generally traced (see Du Cange, <i>Gloss, med.
et infim. Latin</i>.) to the appointment of persons to watch over
the sacred cloak (<i>cappa</i> or <i>capella</i>) of St Martin of Tours, which
was preserved as a relic by the French monarchs. In time of war
this cloak was carried with the army in the field, and was kept
in a tent which itself came to be known as a <i>cappella</i> or <i>capella</i>.
It is also suggested that the <i>capella</i> was simply the tent or canopy
which the French kings erected over the altar in the field for the
worship of the soldiers. However this may be, the name <i>capellanus</i>
was generally applied to those who were in charge of sacred
relics: such officials were also known as <i>custodes, martyrarii,
cubicularii</i>. Thus we hear of a <i>custos palatinae capellae</i> who was
in charge of the palace chapel relics, and guarded them in the
field; the chief of these <i>custodes</i> was sometimes called the <i>archicapellanus</i>.
From the care of sacred relics preserved in royal
chapels, &amp;c. (<i>sacella</i> or <i>capellae</i>), the office of <i>capellanus</i> naturally
extended its scope until it covered practically that of the modern
court chaplain, and was officially recognized by the Church.
These clerics became the confessors in royal and noble houses,
and were generally chosen from among bishops and other high
dignitaries. The arch-chaplain not only received jurisdiction
within the royal household, but represented the authority of the
monarch in religious matters, and also acquired more general
powers. In France the arch-chaplain was grand-almoner, and
both in France and in the Holy Roman Empire was also high
chancellor of the realm. The office was abolished in France at the
Revolution in 1789, revived by Pius IX. in 1857, and again
abolished on the fall of the Second Empire.</p>

<p>The Roman Catholic Church also recognizes a class of beneficed
chaplains, supported out of &ldquo;pious foundations&rdquo; for the specific
duty of saying, or arranging for, certain masses, or taking part in
certain services. These chaplains are classified as follows:&mdash;
<i>Ecclesiastical</i>, if the foundation has been recognized officially
as a benefice; <i>Lay</i>, if this recognition has not been obtained;
<i>Mercenary</i>, if the person who has been entrusted with the duty
of performing or procuring the desired celebration is a layman
(such persons also are sometimes called &ldquo;Lay Chaplains&rdquo;);
<i>Collative</i>, if it is provided that a bishop shall collate or confer the
right to act upon the accepted candidate, who otherwise could
not be recognized as an ecclesiastical chaplain. There are
elaborate regulations governing the appointment and conduct
of these chaplains.</p>

<p>Other classes of chaplains are:&mdash;(1) <i>Parochial</i> or <i>Auxiliary
Chaplains</i>, appointed either by a parish priest (under a provision
authorized by the Council of Trent) or by a bishop to take over
certain specified duties which he is unable to perform; (2)
<i>Chaplains of Convents</i>, appointed by a bishop: these must be
men of mature age, should not be regulars unless secular priests
cannot be obtained, and are not generally to be appointed for
life; (3) <i>Pontifical Chaplains</i>, some of whom (known as Private
Chaplains) assist the pontiff in the celebration of Mass; others
attached directly to the pope are honorary private chaplains
who occasionally assist the private chaplains, private clerics of
the chapel, common chaplains and supernumerary chaplains.
The common chaplains were instituted by Alexander VII.,
and in 1907 were definitely allowed the title &ldquo;Monsignore&rdquo; by
Pius X.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAPLIN, HENRY<a name="ar195" id="ar195"></a></span> (1841-&emsp;&emsp;), English statesman, second
son of the Rev. Henry Chaplin, of Blankney, Lincolnshire, was
educated at Harrow and Christ Church, Oxford, and first entered
parliament in 1868 as Conservative member for Mid-Lincolnshire.
He represented this constituency (which under the Redistribution
Act of 1885 became the Sleaford division) till 1906, when he was
defeated, but in 1907 returned to the House of Commons as
member for Wimbledon at a by-election. In 1876 he married a
daughter of the 3rd duke of Sutherland, but lost his wife in
1881. Outside the House of Commons he was a familiar figure
on the Turf, winning the Derby with Hermit in 1867; and in
politics from the first the &ldquo;Squire of Blankney&rdquo; took an active
interest in agricultural questions, as a popular and typical
representative of the English &ldquo;country gentleman&rdquo; class.
Having filled the office of chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster
in Lord Salisbury&rsquo;s short ministry of 1885-1886, he became
president of the new Board of Agriculture in 1889, with a seat
in the cabinet, and retained this post till 1892. In the Conservative
cabinet of 1895-1900 he was president of the Local Government
Board, and was responsible for the Agricultural Rates Act
of 1896; but he was not included in the ministry after its
reconstruction in 1900. Mr Chaplin had always been an advocate
of protectionism, being in this respect the most prominent
inheritor of the views of Lord George Bentinck; and when in
1903 the Tariff Reform movement began under Mr Chamberlain&rsquo;s
leadership, he gave it his enthusiastic support, becoming a
member of the Tariff Commission and one of the most strenuous
advocates in the country of the new doctrines in opposition
to free trade.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHAPMAN, GEORGE<a name="ar196" id="ar196"></a></span> (? 1559-1634), English poet and
dramatist, was born near Hitchin. The inscription on the
portrait which forms the frontispiece of <i>The Whole Works of
Homer</i> states that he was then (1616) fifty-seven years of age.
Anthony à Wood (<i>Athen. Oxon.</i> ii. 575) says that about 1574 he
was sent to the university, &ldquo;but whether first to this of Oxon, or
that of Cambridge, is to me unknown; sure I am that he
spent some time in Oxon, where he was observed to be most
excellent in the Latin and Greek tongues, but not in logic or
philosophy.&rdquo; Chapman&rsquo;s first extant play, <i>The Blind Beggar
of Alexandria</i>, was produced in 1596, and two years later Francis
Meres mentions him in <i>Palladis Tamia</i> among the &ldquo;best for
tragedie&rdquo; and the &ldquo;best for comedie.&rdquo; Of his life between
leaving the university and settling in London there is no account.
It has been suggested, from the detailed knowledge displayed
in <i>The Shadow of Night</i> of an incident in Sir Francis Vere&rsquo;s
campaign, that he saw service in the Netherlands. There are
frequent entries with regard to Chapman in Henslowe&rsquo;s diary for
the years 1598-1599, but his dramatic activity slackened during
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page853" id="page853"></a>853</span>
the following years, when his attention was chiefly occupied by his
<i>Homer</i>. In 1604 he was imprisoned with John Marston for his
share in <i>Eastward Ho</i>, in which offence was given to the Scottish
party at court. Ben Jonson voluntarily joined the two, who
were soon released. Chapman seems to have enjoyed favour
at court, where he had a patron in Prince Henry, but in 1605
Jonson and he were for a short time in prison again for &ldquo;a play.&rdquo;
Beaumont, the French ambassador in London, in a despatch of
the 5th of April 1608, writes that he had obtained the prohibition
of a performance of <i>Biron</i> in which the queen of France was
represented as giving Mademoiselle de Verneuil a box on the
ears. He adds that three of the actors were imprisoned, but that
the chief culprit, the author, had escaped (Raumer, <i>Briefe aus
Paris</i>, 1831, ii. 276). Among Chapman&rsquo;s patrons was Robert
Carr, earl of Somerset, to whom he remained faithful after his
disgrace. Chapman enjoyed the friendship and admiration of
his great contemporaries. John Webster in the preface to <i>The
White Devil</i> praised &ldquo;his full and heightened style,&rdquo; and Ben
Jonson told Drummond of Hawthornden that Fletcher and Chapman
&ldquo;were loved of him.&rdquo; These friendly relations appear to
have been interrupted later, for there is extant in the Ashmole
MSS. an &ldquo;Invective written by Mr George Chapman against
Mr Ben Jonson.&rdquo; Chapman died in the parish of St Giles
in the Fields, and was buried on the 12th of May 1634 in the
churchyard. A monument to his memory was erected by Inigo
Jones.</p>
<div class="author">(M. Br.)</div>

<p>Chapman, his first biographer is careful to let us know, &ldquo;was
a person of most reverend aspect, religious and temperate,
qualities rarely meeting in a poet&rdquo;; he had also certain other
merits at least as necessary to the exercise of that profession.
He had a singular force and solidity of thought, an admirable
ardour of ambitious devotion to the service of poetry, a deep and
burning sense at once of the duty implied and of the dignity
inherent in his office; a vigour, opulence, and loftiness of phrase,
remarkable even in that age of spiritual strength, wealth and
exaltation of thought and style; a robust eloquence, touched
not unfrequently with flashes of fancy, and kindled at times
into heat of imagination. The main fault of his style is one more
commonly found in the prose than in the verse of his time,&mdash;
a quaint and florid obscurity, rigid with elaborate rhetoric and
tortuous with labyrinthine illustration; not dark only to the
rapid reader through closeness and subtlety of thought, like
Donne, whose miscalled obscurity is so often &ldquo;all glorious
within,&rdquo; but thick and slab as a witch&rsquo;s gruel with forced and
barbarous eccentricities of articulation. As his language in the
higher forms of comedy is always pure and clear, and sometimes
exquisite in the simplicity of its earnest and natural grace, the
stiffness and density of his more ambitious style may perhaps
be attributed to some pernicious theory or conceit of the dignity
proper to a moral and philosophic poet. Nevertheless, many of
the gnomic passages in his tragedies and allegoric poems are of
singular weight and beauty; the best of these, indeed, would not
discredit the fame of the very greatest poets for sublimity of
equal thought and expression: witness the lines chosen by
Shelley as the motto for a poem, and fit to have been chosen as
the motto for his life.</p>

<p>The romantic and sometimes barbaric grandeur of Chapman&rsquo;s
<i>Homer</i> remains attested by the praise of Keats, of Coleridge
and of Lamb; it is written at a pitch of strenuous and laborious
exaltation, which never flags or breaks down, but never flies
with the ease and smoothness of an eagle native to Homeric
air. From his occasional poems an expert and careful hand
might easily gather a noble anthology of excerpts, chiefly
gnomic or meditative, allegoric or descriptive. The most
notable examples of his tragic work are comprised in the series
of plays taken, and adapted sometimes with singular licence,
from the records of such part of French history as lies between
the reign of Francis I. and the reign of Henry IV., ranging in date
of subject from the trial and death of Admiral Chabot to the
treason and execution of Marshal Biron. The two plays bearing
as epigraph the name of that famous soldier and conspirator are
a storehouse of lofty thought and splendid verse, with scarcely
a flash or sparkle of dramatic action. The one play of Chapman&rsquo;s
whose popularity on the stage survived the Restoration is
<i>Bussy d&rsquo;Ambois</i> (d&rsquo;Amboise),&mdash;a tragedy not lacking in violence
of action or emotion, and abounding even more in sweet and sublime
interludes than in crabbed and bombastic passages. His
rarest jewels of thought and verse detachable from the context
lie embedded in the tragedy of <i>Caesar and Pompey</i>, whence the
finest of them were first extracted by the unerring and unequalled
critical genius of Charles Lamb. In most of his tragedies the
lofty and labouring spirit of Chapman may be said rather to
shine fitfully through parts than steadily to pervade the whole;
they show nobly altogether as they stand, but even better by
help of excerpts and selections. But the excellence of his best
comedies can only be appreciated by a student who reads them
fairly and fearlessly through, and, having made some small
deductions on the score of occasional pedantry and occasional
indecency, finds in <i>All Fools</i>, <i>Monsieur d&rsquo;Olive</i>, <i>The Gentleman
Usher</i>, and <i>The Widow&rsquo;s Tears</i> a wealth and vigour of humorous
invention, a tender and earnest grace of romantic poetry, which
may atone alike for these passing blemishes and for the lack of
such clear-cut perfection of character and such dramatic progression
of interest as we find only in the yet higher poets of the
English heroic age.</p>

<p>So much it may suffice to say of Chapman as an original
poet, one who held of no man and acknowledged no master, but
from the birth of Marlowe well-nigh to the death of Jonson held
on his own hard and haughty way of austere and sublime ambition,
not without kindly and graceful inclination of his high
grey head to salute such younger and still nobler compeers as
Jonson and Fletcher. With Shakespeare we should never have
guessed that he had come at all in contact, had not the keen
intelligence of William Minto divined or rather discerned him
to be the rival poet referred to in Shakespeare&rsquo;s sonnets with a
grave note of passionate satire, hitherto as enigmatic as almost
all questions connected with those divine and dangerous poems.
This conjecture Professor Minto fortified by such apt collocation
and confrontation of passages that we may now reasonably accept
it as an ascertained and memorable fact.</p>

<p>The objections which a just and adequate judgment may
bring against Chapman&rsquo;s master-work, his translation of Homer,
may be summed up in three epithets: it is romantic, laborious,
Elizabethan. The qualities implied by these epithets are the
reverse of those which should distinguish a translator of Homer;
but setting this apart, and considering the poems as in the main
original works, the superstructure of a romantic poet on the
submerged foundations of Greek verse, no praise can be too
warm or high for the power, the freshness, the indefatigable
strength and inextinguishable fire which animate this exalted
work, and secure for all time that shall take cognizance of English
poetry an honoured place in its highest annals for the memory
of Chapman.</p>

both bear Chapman&rsquo;s name on the title-page, but his authorship has
been disputed. In <i>The Ball</i> (lic. 1632; pr. 1639), a comedy, and
<i>The Tragedie of Chabot Admirall of France</i> (lic. 1635; pr. 1639) he
collaborated with James Shirley. <i>The memorable Masque of the two

of the Princess Elizabeth.</p>

<p><i>The Whole Works of Homer: Prince of Poets. In his Iliads and
Odysseys ...</i> appeared in 1616, and about 1624 he added <i>The Crowne
of all Homers works Batrachomyomachia or the Battaile of Frogs and
Mise. His Hymns and Epigrams.</i> But the whole works had been
already published by instalments. <i>Seaven Bookes of the Iliades of
Homer</i> had appeared in 1598, <i>Achilles Shield</i> in the same year,
books i.-xii. about 1609; in 1611 <i>The Iliads of Homer, Prince of
Poets</i> ...; and in 1614 <i>Twenty-four Bookes of Homer&rsquo;s Odisses</i>
were entered at Stationers&rsquo; Hall. In 1609 he addressed to Prince
Henry <i>Enthymiae Raptus; or the Teares of Peace</i>, and on the death
of his patron he contributed <i>An Epicede, or Funerall Song</i> (1612).
A paraphrase of <i>Petrarchs Seven Penitentiall Psalms</i> (1612), a poem

an elegy on Sir William Russell, complete the list of his separately
published works.</p>

<p>Chapman&rsquo;s <i>Homer</i> was edited in 1857 by the Rev. Richard Hooper;
and a reprint of his dramatic works appeared in 1873. The standard
edition of Chapman is the <i>Works</i>, edited by R.H. Shepherd (1874-1875),
the third volume of which contains an &ldquo;Essay on the Poetical
and Dramatic works of George Chapman,&rdquo; by Mr Swinburne, printed
separately in 1875. The selection of his plays (1895) for the Mermaid
Series is edited by Mr W.L. Phelps. For the sources of the plays
see Emil Koeppel, &ldquo;Anellen Studien zu den Dramen George Chapman&rsquo;s,
Philip Massinger&rsquo;s und John Ford&rsquo;s&rdquo; in <i>Quellen und Forschungen
zur Sprach und Kulturgeschichte</i> (vol. 82, Strassburg, 1897).
The suggestion of W. Minto (see <i>Characteristics of the English Poets</i>,
1885) that Chapman was the &ldquo;rival poet&rdquo; of Shakespeare&rsquo;s sonnets
is amplified in Mr A. Acheson&rsquo;s <i>Shakespeare and the Rival Poet</i> (1903).
Much satire in Chapman&rsquo;s introduction is there applied to Shakespeare.

<p><span class="bold">CHAPONE, HESTER<a name="ar198" id="ar198"></a></span> (1727-1801), English essayist, daughter
of Thomas Mulso, a country gentleman, was born at Twywell,
Northamptonshire, on the 27th of October 1727. She was a
precocious child, and at the age of nine wrote a romance
entitled <i>The Loves of Amoret and Melissa</i>. Hecky Mulso,
as she was familiarly called, developed a beautiful voice, which
earned her the name of &ldquo;the linnet.&rdquo; While on a visit to
Canterbury she made the acquaintance of the learned Mrs
Elizabeth Carter, and soon became one of the admirers of the
novelist Samuel Richardson. She was one of the little court
of women who gathered at North End, Fulham; and in Miss
Susannah Highmore&rsquo;s sketch of the novelist reading <i>Sir Charles
Grandison</i> to his friends Miss Mulso is the central figure. She
corresponded with Richardson on &ldquo;filial obedience&rdquo; in letters
as long as his own, signing herself his &ldquo;ever obliged and affectionate
child.&rdquo; She admired, however, with discrimination,
and in the words of her biographer (<i>Posthumous Works</i>, 1807,
p. 9) &ldquo;her letters show with what dignity, tempered with proper
humility, she could maintain her own well-grounded opinion.&rdquo;
In 1760 Miss Mulso, with her father&rsquo;s reluctant consent, married
the attorney, John Chapone, who had been befriended by
Richardson. Her husband died within a year of her marriage.
Mrs Chapone remained in London visiting various friends.
She had already made small contributions to various periodicals
when she published, in 1772, her best known work, <i>Letters on
the Improvement of the Mind.</i> This book brought her numerous
requests from distinguished persons to undertake the education
of their children. She died on the 25th of December 1801.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAPPE, CLAUDE<a name="ar199" id="ar199"></a></span> (1763-1805), French engineer, was born
at Brûlon (Sarthe) in 1763. He was the inventor of an optical
telegraph which was widely used in France until it was superseded
by the electric telegraph. His device consisted of an
upright post, on the top of which was fastened a transverse bar,
while at the ends of the latter two smaller arms moved on pivots.
The position of these bars represented words or letters; and by
means of machines placed at intervals such that each was
distinctly visible from the next, messages could be conveyed
through 50 leagues in a quarter of an hour. The machine was
adopted by the Legislative Assembly in 1792, and in the following
year Chappe was appointed <i>ingénieur-télégraphe</i>; but the
originality of his invention was so much questioned that he
was seized with melancholia and (it is said) committed suicide
at Paris in 1805.</p>

<p>His elder brother, Ignace Urbain Jean Chappe (1760-1829),
took part in the invention of the telegraph, and with a younger
brother, Pierre François, from 1805 to 1823 was administrator
of the telegraphs, a post which was also held by two other
brothers, René and Abraham, from 1823 to 1830. Ignace was
the author of a <i>Histoire de la télégraphie</i> (1824). An uncle, Jean
Chappe d&rsquo;Auteroche (1728-1769), was an astronomer who
observed two transits of Venus, one in Siberia in 1761, and the
other in 1769 in California, where he died.</p>

Society in 1840, and his publication of the standard work <i>Popular
Music of the Olden Time</i> (1855-1859)&mdash;an expansion of a collection
of &ldquo;national English airs&rdquo; made by him in 1838-1840.
The modern revival of interest in English folk-songs owes much
to this work, which has since been re-edited by Professor H.E.
Wooldridge (1893). W. Chappell died on the 20th of August
1888. His brother, Thomas Patey Chappell (d. 1902), meanwhile
had largely extended the publishing business, and had started
(1859) the Monday and Saturday Popular Concerts at St James&rsquo;s
Hall, which were successfully managed by a younger brother,
S. Arthur Chappell, till they came to an end towards the close
of the century.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAPTAL, JEAN ANTOINE CLAUDE,<a name="ar202" id="ar202"></a></span> <span class="sc">Comte de Chante-loup</span>
(1756-1832), French chemist and statesman, was born at
Nogaret, Lozère, on the 4th of June 1756. The son of an
apothecary, he studied chemistry at Montpellier, obtaining his
doctor&rsquo;s diploma in 1777, when he repaired to Paris. In 1781
the States of Languedoc founded a chair of chemistry for him
at the school of medicine in Montpellier, where he taught the
doctrines of Lavoisier. The capital he acquired by the death
of a wealthy uncle he employed in the establishment of chemical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page855" id="page855"></a>855</span>
works for the manufacture of the mineral acids, alum, white-lead,
soda and other substances. His labours in the cause of applied
science were at length recognized by the French government,
which presented him with letters of nobility, and the cordon of
the order of Saint Michel. During the Revolution a publication
by Chaptal, entitled <i>Dialogue entre un Montagnard et un Girondin</i>,
caused him to be arrested; but being speedily set at liberty
through the intermission of his friends, he undertook, in 1793,
the management of the saltpetre works at Grenelle. In the
following year he went to Montpellier, where he remained till
1797, when he returned to Paris. After the <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i> of the 18th
of Brumaire (November 9, 1799) he was made a councillor of state
by the First Consul, and succeeded Lucien Bonaparte as minister
of the interior, in which capacity he established a chemical
manufactory near Paris, a school of arts, and a society of industries;
he also reorganized the hospitals, introduced the metrical
system of weights and measures, and otherwise greatly
encouraged the arts and sciences. A misunderstanding between
him and Napoleon (who conferred upon him the title of comte de
Chanteloup) occasioned Chaptal&rsquo;s retirement from office in 1804;
but before the end of that year he was again received into favour
by the emperor, who bestowed on him the grand cross of the
Legion of Honour, and made him treasurer to the conservative
senate. On Napoleon&rsquo;s return from Elba, Chaptal was made
director-general of commerce and manufactures and a minister
of state. He was obliged after the downfall of the emperor to
withdraw into private life; and his name was removed from the
list of the peers of France until 1819. In 1816, however, he was
nominated a member of the Academy of Sciences by Louis XVIII.
Chaptal was especially a popularizer of science, attempting to
apply to industry and agriculture the discoveries of chemistry.
In this way he contributed largely to the development of modern
industry. He died at Paris on the 30th of July 1832.</p>

<p>His literary works exhibit both vigour and perspicuity of style;
he wrote, in addition to various articles, especially in the <i>Annales

<p><span class="bold">CHAPTER<a name="ar203" id="ar203"></a></span> (a shortened form of <i>chapiter</i>, a word still used in
architecture for a capital; derived from O. Fr. <i>chapitre</i>, Lat.
<i>capitellum</i>, diminutive of <i>caput</i>, head), a principal division or
section of a book, and so applied to acts of parliament, as forming
&ldquo;chapters&rdquo; or divisions of the legislation of a session of parliament.
The name &ldquo;chapter&rdquo; is given to the permanent body
of the canons of a cathedral or collegiate church, presided over,
in the English Church, by the dean, and in the Roman communion
by the provost or the dean, and also to the body of the members
of a religious order. This may be a &ldquo;conventual&rdquo; chapter of
the monks of a particular monastery, &ldquo;provincial&rdquo; of the
members of the order in a province, or &ldquo;general&rdquo; of the whole
order. This ecclesiastical use of the word arose from the custom
of reading a chapter of Scripture, or a head (<i>capitulum</i>) of the
<i>regula</i>, to the assembled canons or monks. The transference
from the reading to the assembly itself, and to the members
constituting it, was easy, through such phrases as <i>convenire
ad capitulum</i>. The title &ldquo;chapter&rdquo; is similarly used of the
assembled body of knights of a military or other order. (See

of the monastic bodies (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Abbey</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Cathedral</a></span>) assembled
to transact business. They are of various forms; some are
oblong apartments, as Canterbury, Exeter, Chester, Gloucester,
&amp;c.; some octagonal, as Salisbury, Westminster, Wells, Lincoln,
York, &amp;c. That at Lincoln has ten sides, and that at Worcester
is circular; most are vaulted internally and polygonal externally,
and some, as Salisbury, Wells, Lincoln, Worcester, &amp;c., depend
on a single slight vaulting shaft for the support of the massive
vaulting. They are often provided with a vestibule, as at Westminster,
Lincoln, Salisbury and are almost exclusively English.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAPU,<a name="ar205" id="ar205"></a></span> formerly an important maritime town of China, in
the province of Cheh-kiang, 50 m. N.W. of Chên-hai, situated
in one of the richest and best cultivated districts in the country.
It is the port of Hang-chow, with which it has good canal communication,
and it was formerly the only Chinese port trading
with Japan. The town has a circuit of about 5 m. exclusive of
the suburbs that lie along the beach; and the Tatar quarter is
separated from the rest by a wall. It was captured and much
injured by the British force in 1842, but was abandoned immediately
after the engagement. The sea around it has now
silted up, though in the middle of the 19th century it was
accessible to the light-draught ships of the British fleet.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHAR<a name="ar206" id="ar206"></a></span> (<i>Salvelinus</i>), a fish of the family Salmonidae, represented
in Europe, Asia and North America. The best known and most
widely distributed species, the one represented in British and
Irish lakes, is <i>S. alpinus</i>, a graceful and delicious fish, covered
with very minute scales and usually dark olive, bluish or purplish
black above, with or without round orange or red spots, pinkish
white or yellowish pink to scarlet or claret red below. When the
char go to sea, they assume a more silvery coloration, similar to
that of the salmon and sea trout; the red spots become very
indistinct and the lower parts are almost white. The very young
are also silvery on the sides and white below, and bear 11 to 15
bars, or parr-marks, on the side. This fish varies much according
to localities; and the difference in colour, together with a few
points of doubtful constancy, have given rise to the establishment
of a great number of untenable so-called species, as many as
seven having been ascribed to the British and Irish fauna, viz.
<i>S. alpinus, nivalis, killinensis, willoughbyi, perisii, colii</i> and <i>grayi</i>,
the last from Lough Melvin, Ireland, being the most distinct.
<i>S. alpinus</i> varies much in size according to the waters it inhabits,
remaining dwarfed in some English lakes, and growing to 2 ft.
or more in other localities. In other parts of Europe, also, various
local forms have been distinguished, such as the &ldquo;omble
chevalier&rdquo; of the lakes of Switzerland and Savoy (<i>S. umbla</i>), the
&ldquo;Säbling&rdquo; of the lakes of South Germany and Austria (<i>S. salvelinus</i>),
the &ldquo;kullmund&rdquo; of Norway (<i>S. carbonarius</i>), &amp;c.,
while the North American <i>S. parkei, alipes, stagnalis, arcturus,
areolus, oquassa</i> and <i>marstoni</i> may also be regarded as varieties.
Taken in this wide sense, <i>S. alpinus</i> has a very extensive distribution.
In central Europe, in the British islands and in the greater
part of Scandinavia it is confined to mountain lakes, but farther
to the north, in both the Old World and the New, it lives in the sea
and ascends rivers to spawn. In Lapland, Iceland, Greenland
and other parts of the arctic regions, it ranks among the commonest
fishes. The extreme northern point at which char
have been obtained is 82° 34&prime; N. (Victoria lake and Floeberg
Beach, Arctic America). It reaches an altitude of 2600 ft. in the
Alps and 6000 ft. in the Carpathians.</p>

<p>The American brook char, <i>S. fontinalis</i>, is a close ally of <i>S.
alpinus</i>, differing from it in having fewer and shorter gill-rakers,
a rather stouter body, the back more or less barred or marbled
with dark olive or black, and the dorsal and caudal fins mottled
or barred with black. Many local varieties of colour have been
distinguished. Sea-run individuals are often nearly plain bright
silvery. It is a small species, growing to about 18 in. abundant in
all clear, cold streams of North America, east of the Mississippi,
northward to Labrador. The fish has been introduced into other
parts of the United States, and also into Europe.</p>

<p>Another member of the same section of Salmonidae is the Great
Lake char of North America, <i>S. namaycush</i>, one of the largest
salmonids, said to attain a weight of 100 &#8468; The body is very
elongate and covered with extremely small scales. The colour
varies from grey to black, with numerous round pale spots,
which may be tinged with reddish; the dorsal and caudal fins
reticulate with darker. This fish inhabits the Great Lakes
regions and neighbouring parts of North America.</p>

distinctive mark (spelt &ldquo;caracter&rdquo; up to the 16th century, with
other variants); so applied to symbols of notation or letters of
the alphabet; more figuratively, the distinguishing traits of
anything, and particularly the moral and mental qualities of an
individual human being, the sum of those qualities which distinguish
him as a personality. From the latter usage &ldquo;a
character&rdquo; becomes almost identical with &ldquo;reputation&rdquo;; and
in the sense of &ldquo;giving a servant a character,&rdquo; the word involves
a written testimonial. For the law relating to servants&rsquo; characters
see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Master and Servant</a></span>. A further development
is the use of &ldquo;character&rdquo; to mean an &ldquo;odd or eccentric person&rdquo;;
or of a &ldquo;character actor,&rdquo; to mean an actor who plays a highly-coloured
strange part. The word is also used as the name of a
form of literature, consisting of short descriptions of types of
character. Well-known examples of such &ldquo;characters&rdquo; are
those of Theophrastus and La Bruyère, and in English, of Joseph
Hall (1574-1656) and Sir Thomas Overbury.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHARADE,<a name="ar209" id="ar209"></a></span> a kind of riddle, probably invented in France
during the 18th century, in which a word of two or more syllables
is divined by guessing and combining into one word (the answer)
the different syllables, each of which is described, as an independent
word, by the giver of the charade. Charades may be
either in prose or verse. Of poetic charades those by W. Mackworth
Praed are well known and excellent examples, while the
following specimens in prose may suffice as illustrations. &ldquo;My
<i>first</i>, with the most rooted antipathy to a Frenchman, prides
himself, whenever they meet, upon sticking close to his jacket;
my <i>second</i> has many virtues, nor is its least that it gives its name
to my first; my <i>whole</i> may I never catch!&rdquo; &ldquo;My <i>first</i> is
company; my <i>second</i> shuns company; my <i>third</i> collects company;
and my <i>whole</i> amuses company.&rdquo; The solutions are
<i>Tar-tar</i> and <i>Co-nun-drum</i>. The most popular form of this
amusement is the acted charade, in which the meaning of the
different syllables is acted out on the stage, the audience being
left to guess each syllable and thus, combining the meaning of
all the syllables, the whole word. A brilliant example of the
acted charade is described in Thackeray&rsquo;s <i>Vanity Fair</i>.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHARCOAL,<a name="ar210" id="ar210"></a></span> the blackish residue consisting of impure carbon
obtained by removing the volatile constituents of animal and
vegetable substances; wood gives origin to wood-charcoal;
sugar to sugar-charcoal; bone to bone-charcoal (which, however,
mainly consists of calcium phosphate); while coal gives &ldquo;coke&rdquo;
and &ldquo;gas-carbon.&rdquo; The first part of the word charcoal is of
obscure origin. The independent use of &ldquo;char,&rdquo; meaning to
scorch, to reduce to carbon, is comparatively recent, and must
have been taken from &ldquo;charcoal,&rdquo; which is quite early. The
<i>New English Dictionary</i> gives as the earliest instance of &ldquo;char&rdquo;
a quotation dated 1679. Similarly the word &ldquo;chark&rdquo; or &ldquo;chak,&rdquo;
meaning the same as &ldquo;char,&rdquo; is also late, and is probably due
to a wrong division of the word &ldquo;charcoal,&rdquo; or, as it was often
spelled in the 16th and 17th centuries, &ldquo;charkole&rdquo; and &ldquo;charke-coal.&rdquo;
No suggestions for an origin of &ldquo;char&rdquo; are satisfactory.
It may be a use of the word &ldquo;chare,&rdquo; which appears in &ldquo;char-woman,&rdquo;
the American &ldquo;chore&rdquo;; in all these words it means
&ldquo;turn,&rdquo; a turn of work, a job, and &ldquo;charcoal&rdquo; would have to
mean &ldquo;turned coal,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> wood changed or turned to coal, a
somewhat forced derivation, for which there is no authority.
Another suggestion is that it is connected with &ldquo;chirk&rdquo; or
&ldquo;chark,&rdquo; an old word meaning &ldquo;to make a grating noise.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Wood-charcoal.</i>&mdash;In districts where there is an abundance of
wood, as in the forests of France, Austria and Sweden, the
operation of charcoal-burning is of the crudest description. The
method, which dates back to a very remote period, generally
consists in piling billets of wood on their ends so as to form a
conical pile, openings being left at the bottom to admit air, with
a central shaft to serve as a flue. The whole is covered with turf
of moistened soil. The firing is begun at the bottom of the flue,
and gradually spreads outwards and upwards. The success of
the operation&mdash;both as to the intrinsic value of the product and
its amount&mdash;depends upon the rate of the combustion. Under
average conditions, 100 parts of wood yield about 60 parts by
volume, or 25 parts by weight, of charcoal. The modern process
of carbonizing wood&mdash;either in small pieces or as sawdust&mdash;in
cast iron retorts is extensively practised where wood is scarce,
and also by reason of the recovery of valuable by-products
(wood spirit, pyroligneous acid, wood-tar), which the process
permits. The question of the temperature of the carbonization
is important; according to J. Percy, wood becomes brown at
220° C., a deep brown-black after some time at 280°, and an easily
powdered mass at 310°. Charcoal made at 300° is brown, soft
and friable, and readily inflames at 380°; made at higher
temperatures it is hard and brittle, and does not fire until heated
to about 700°. One of the most important applications of wood-charcoal
is as a constituent of gunpowder (<i>q.v.</i>). It is also used
in metallurgical operations as a reducing agent, but its application
has been diminished by the introduction of coke, anthracite
smalls, &amp;c. A limited quantity is made up into the form of
drawing crayons; but the greatest amount is used as a fuel.</p>

<p>The porosity of wood-charcoal explains why it floats on the
surface of water, although it is actually denser, its specific gravity
being about 1.5. The porosity also explains the property of
absorbing gases and vapours; at ordinary temperatures ammonia
and cyanogen are most readily taken up; and Sir James Dewar
has utilized this property for the preparation of high vacua at
low temperatures. This character is commercially applied in
the use of wood-charcoal as a disinfectant. The fetid gases
produced by the putrefaction and waste of organic matter enter
into the pores of the charcoal, and there meet with the oxygen
previously absorbed from the atmosphere; oxidation ensues,
and the noxious effluvia are decomposed. Generally, however,
the action is a purely mechanical one, the gases being only
absorbed. Its pharmacological action depends on the same
property; it absorbs the gases of the stomach and intestines
(hence its use in cases of flatulence), and also liquids and solids.
Wood-charcoal has also the power of removing colouring matters
from solutions, but this property is possessed in a much higher
degree by animal-charcoal.</p>

<p><i>Animal-charcoal</i> or <i>bone black</i> is the carbonaceous residue
obtained by the dry distillation of bones; it contains only about
10% of carbon, the remainder being calcium and magnesium
phosphates (80%) and other inorganic material originally present
in the bones. It is generally manufactured from the residues
obtained in the glue (<i>q.v.</i>) and gelatin (<i>q.v.</i>) industries. Its
decolorizing power was applied in 1812 by Derosne to the
clarification of the syrups obtained in sugar-refining; but its
use in this direction has now greatly diminished, owing to the
introduction of more active and easily managed reagents. It is
still used to some extent in laboratory practice. The decolorizing
power is not permanent, becoming lost after using for some
time; it may be revived, however, by washing and reheating.</p>

<p><i>Lampblack</i> or <i>soot</i> is the familiar product of the incomplete
combustion of oils, pitch, resins, tallow, &amp;c. It is generally
prepared by burning pitch residues (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Coal-tar</a></span>) and condensing
the product. Thus obtained it is always oily, and, before using
as a pigment, it must be purified by ignition in closed crucibles
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Carbon</a></span>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHARCOT, JEAN MARTIN<a name="ar211" id="ar211"></a></span> (1825-1893), French physician,
was born in Paris on the 29th of November 1825. In 1853 he
graduated as M.D. of Paris University, and three years later was
appointed physician of the Central Hospital Bureau. In 1860
he became professor of pathological anatomy in the medical
faculty of Paris, and in 1862 began that famous connexion with
the Salpêtrière which lasted to the end of his life. He was elected
to the Academy of Medicine in 1873, and ten years afterwards
became a member of the Institute. His death occurred suddenly
on the 16th of August 1893 at Morvan, where he had gone for a
holiday. Charcot, who was a good linguist and well acquainted
with the literature of his own as well as of other countries, excelled
as a clinical observer and a pathologist. His work at the
Salpêtrière exerted a great influence on the development of the
science of neurology, and his classical <i>Leçons sur les maladies du
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page857" id="page857"></a>857</span>
système nerveux</i>, the first series of which was published in
1873, represents an enormous advance in the knowledge and
discrimination of nervous diseases. He also devoted much
attention to the study of obscure morbid conditions like
hysteria, especially in relation to hypnotism (<i>q.v.</i>); indeed, it is
in connexion with his investigation into the phenomena and
results of the latter that his name is popularly known. In addition
to his labours on neurological and even physiological problems
he made many contributions to other branches of medicine, his
published works dealing, among other topics, with liver and
kidney diseases, gout and pulmonary phthisis. As a teacher
he was remarkably successful, and always commanded an
enthusiastic band of followers.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHARD, JOHN ROUSE MERRIOTT<a name="ar212" id="ar212"></a></span> (1847-1897), British
soldier, was born at Boxhill, near Plymouth, on the 21st of
December 1847, and in 1868 entered the Royal Engineers. In
1878 Lieutenant Chard was ordered to South Africa to take
part in the Zulu War, and was stationed at the small post of
Rorke&rsquo;s Drift to protect the bridges across the Buffalo river,
and some sick men and stores. Here, with Lieutenant Gonville
Bromhead (1856-1891) and eighty men of the 2nd 24th Foot,
he heard, on the 22nd of January 1879, of the disaster of Isandhlwana
from some fugitives who had escaped the slaughter.
Believing that the victorious Zulus would attempt to cross into
Natal, they prepared, hastily, to hold the Drift until help
should come. They barricaded and loopholed the old church
and hospital, and improvised defences from wagons, mealie
sacks and bags of Indian corn. Early in the afternoon they were
attacked by more than 3000 Zulus, who, after hours of desperate
hand-to-hand fighting, carried the outer defences, an inner low
wall of biscuit boxes, and the hospital, room by room. The
garrison then retired to the stone kraal, and repulsed attack
after attack through the night. The next morning relieving
forces appeared, and the enemy retired. The spirited defence
of Rorke&rsquo;s Drift saved Natal from a Zulu invasion, and Chard&rsquo;s
and Bromhead&rsquo;s gallantry was rewarded with the V.C. and
immediate promotion to the rank of captain and brevet-major.
On Chard&rsquo;s return to England he became a popular hero. From
1893-1896 he commanded the Royal Engineers at Singapore,
and was made a colonel in 1897. He died the same year at
Hatch-Beauchamp, near Taunton, on the 1st of November.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHARD,<a name="ar213" id="ar213"></a></span> a market town and municipal borough in the Southern
parliamentary division of Somersetshire, England, 142½ m. W.
by S. of London by the London &amp; South Western railway.
Pop. (1901) 4437. It stands on high ground within 1 m. of the
Devonshire border. Its cruciform parish church of St Mary
the Virgin is Perpendicular of the 15th century. A fine east
window is preserved. The manufactures include linen, lace,
woollens, brassware and ironware. Chard is governed by a
mayor, 4 aldermen and 12 councillors. Area, 444 acres.</p>

<p>Chard (<i>Cerdre</i>, <i>Cherdre</i>, <i>Cherde</i>) was commercial in origin,
being a trade centre near the Roman road to the west. There
are two Roman villas in the parish. There was a British camp
at Neroche in the neighbourhood. The bishop of Bath held
Chard in 1086, and his successor granted in 1234 the first charter
which made Chard a free borough, each burgage paying a rent
of 12d. Trade in hides was forbidden to non-burgesses. This
charter was confirmed in 1253, 1280 and 1285. Chard is said
to have been incorporated by Elizabeth, as the corporation seal
dates from 1570, but no Elizabethan charter can be found.
It was incorporated by grant of Charles I. in 1642, and Charles
II. gave a charter in 1683. Chard was a mesne borough, the
first overlord being Bishop Joceline, whose successors held it
(with a brief interval from 1545 to 1552) until 1801, when it was
sold to Earl Poulett. Parliamentary representation began in
1312, and was lost in 1328. A market on Monday and fair on the
25th of July were granted in 1253, and confirmed in 1642 and
1683, when two more fair days were added (November 2 and
May 3), the market being changed to Tuesday. The market day
is now Monday, fairs being held on the first Wednesday in May,
August and November, for corn and cattle only, their medieval
importance as centres of the cloth trade having departed.</p>

native country, he set out again for Persia in August 1671.
This second journey was much more adventurous than the first,
as instead of going directly to his destination, he passed by
Smyrna, Constantinople, the Crimea, Caucasia, Mingrelia and
Georgia, and did not reach Ispahan till June 1673. After four
years spent in researches throughout Persia, he again visited
India, and returned to Europe by the Cape of Good Hope in
1677. The persecution of Protestants in France led him, in
1681, to settle in London, where he was appointed jeweller to
the court, and received from Charles II. the honour of knighthood.
In 1683 he was sent to Holland as representative of the English
East India Company; and in 1686 he published the first part
of his great narrative&mdash;<i>The Travels of Sir John Chardin into
Persia and the East Indies, &amp;c.</i> (London). Sir John died in
London in 1713, and was buried in Westminster Abbey, where
his monument bears the inscription <i>Nomen sibi fecit eundo</i>.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>It was not till 1711 that the complete account of Chardin&rsquo;s travels
appeared, under the title of <i>Journal du voyage du chevalier Chardin</i>,
at Amsterdam. The Persian portion is to be found in vol. ii. of
Harris&rsquo;s <i>Collection</i>, and extracts are reprinted by Pinkerton in vol. ix.
The best complete reprint is by Langlès (Paris, 1811). Sir John
Chardin&rsquo;s narrative has received the highest praise from the most
competent authorities for its fulness, comprehensiveness and fidelity;
and it furnished Montesquieu, Rousseau, Gibbon and Helvétius
with most important material.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHARENTE,<a name="ar216" id="ar216"></a></span> an inland department of south-western France,
comprehending the ancient province of Angoumois, and inconsiderable
portions of Saintonge, Poitou, Marche, Limousin and
Périgord. It is bounded N. by the departments of Deux-Sèvres
and Vienne, E. by those of Vienne and Dordogne, S. by Dordogne
and W. by Charente-Inférieure. Area 2305 sq. m. Pop. (1906)
351,733. The department, though it contains no high altitudes,
is for the most part of a hilly nature. The highest points, many
of which exceed 1000 ft., are found in the Confolentais, the
granite region of the extreme north-east, known also as the
Terres Froides. In the Terres Chaudes, under which name
the remainder of the department is included, the levels vary
in general between 300 and 650 ft., except in the western plains&mdash;the
Pays-Bas and Champagne&mdash;where they range from 40 to
300 ft. A large part of Charente is thickly wooded, the principal
forests lying in its northern districts. The department, as its
name indicates, belongs mainly to the basin of the river Charente
(area of basin 3860 sq. m.; length of river 225 m.), the chief
affluents of which, within its borders, are the Tardoire, the
Touvre and the Né. The Confolentais is watered by the Vienne,
a tributary of the Loire, while the arrondissement of Barbexieux
in the south-west belongs almost wholly to the basin of the
Gironde.</p>

<p>The climate is temperate but moist, the rainfall being highest
in the north-east. Agriculturally, Charente is prosperous. More
than half its surface is arable land, on the greater part of which
cereals are grown. The potato is an important crop. The
vine is predominant in the region of Champagne, the wine
produced being chiefly distilled into the famous brandy to which
the town of Cognac gives its name. The best pasture is found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page858" id="page858"></a>858</span>
in the Confolentais, where horned cattle are largely reared.
The chief fruits are chestnuts, walnuts and cider-apples. The
poultry raised in the neighbourhood of Barbezieux is highly
esteemed. Charente has numerous stone quarries, and there
are peat workings and beds of clay which supply brick and
tile-works and earthenware manufactories. Among the other
industries, paper-making, which has its chief centre at Angoulême,
is foremost. The most important metallurgical establishment
is the large foundry of naval guns at Ruelle. Flour-mills and
leather-works are numerous. There are also many minor
industries subsidiary to paper-making and brandy-distilling,
and Angoulême manufactures gunpowder and confectionery.
Coal, salt and timber are prominent imports. Exports include
paper, brandy, stone and agricultural products. The department
is served chiefly by the Orlêans and Ouest-État railways,
and the Charente is navigable below Angoulême. Charente is
divided into the five arrondissements of Angoulême, Cognac,
Ruffec, Barbezieux and Confolens (29 cantons, 426 communes).
It belongs to the region of the XII. army corps, to the province
of the archbishop of Bordeaux, and to the académie (educational
division) of Poitiers. Its court of appeal is at Bordeaux.</p>

<p>Angoulême (the capital), Cognac, Confolens, Jarnac and La
Rochefoucauld (<i>q.v.</i>) are the more noteworthy places in the department.
Barbezieux and Ruffec, capitals of arrondissements
and agricultural centres, are otherwise of little importance. The
department abounds in churches of Romanesque architecture,
of which those of Bassac, St Amant-de-Boixe (portions of which
are Gothic in style), Plassac and Gensac-la-Pallue may be
mentioned. There are remains of a Gothic abbey church at
La Couronne, and Roman remains at St Cybardeaux, Brossac
and Chassenon (where there are ruins of the Gallo-Roman town
of Cassinomagus).</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHARENTE-INFÉRIEURE,<a name="ar217" id="ar217"></a></span> a maritime department of south-western
France, comprehending the old provinces of Saintonge
and Aunis, and a small portion of Poitou, and including the
islands of Ré, Oléron, Aix and Madame. Area, 2791 sq.m.
Pop. (1906) 453,793. It is bounded N. by Vendée, N.E. by
Deux-Sèvres, E. by Charente, S.E. by Dordogne, S.W. by
Gironde and the estuary of the Gironde, and W. by the Bay of
Biscay. Plains and low hills occupy the interior; the coast is
flat and marshy, as are the islands (Ré, Aix, Oléron) which lie
opposite to it. The department takes its name from the river
Charente, which traverses it during the last 61 m. of its course
and drains the central region. Its chief tributaries are on the
right the Boutonne, on the left the Seugne. The climate is
temperate and, except along the coast, healthy. There are
several sheltered bays on the coast, and several good harbours,
the chief of which are La Rochelle, Rochefort and Tonnay-Charente,
the two latter some distance up the Charente. Royan
on the north shore of the Gironde is an important watering-place
much frequented for its bathing.</p>

<p>The majority of the inhabitants of Charente-Inférieure live
by agriculture. The chief products of the arable land are wheat,
oats, maize, barley and the potato. Horse and cattle-raising is
carried on and dairying is prosperous. A considerable quantity
of wine, most of which is distilled into brandy, is produced.
The department has a few peat-workings, and produces freestone,
lime and cement; the salt-marshes of the coast are important
sources of mineral wealth. Glass, pottery, bricks and earthenware
are prominent industrial products. Ship-building, brandy-distilling,
iron-founding and machine construction are also
carried on. Oysters and mussels are bred in the neighbourhood
of La Rochelle and Marennes, and there are numerous fishing
ports along the coast.</p>

<p>The railways traversing the department belong to the
Ouest-État system, except one section of the Paris-Bordeaux
line belonging to the Orléans Company. The facilities of the
department for internal communication are greatly increased
by the number of navigable streams which water it. The
Charente, the Sèvre Niortaise, the Boutonne, the Seudre and
the Gironde furnish 142 m. of navigable waterway, to which
must be added the 56 m. covered by the canals of the coast.
There are 6 arrondissements (40 cantons, 481 communes), cognominal
with the towns of La Rochelle, Rochefort, Marennes,
Saintes, Jonzac and St Jean d&rsquo;Angély&mdash;La Rochelle being
the chief town of the department. The department forms the
diocese of La Rochelle, and is attached to the 18th military
region, and in educational matters to the académie of Poitiers.
Its court of appeal is at Poitiers.</p>

<p>La Rochelle, St Jean d&rsquo;Angély, Rochefort and Saintes (<i>q.v.</i>) are
the principal towns. Surgères and Aulnay possess fine specimens
of the numerous Romanesque churches. Pons has a graceful
château of the 15th and 16th centuries, beside which there rises
a fine keep of the 12th century.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHARENTON-LE-PONT,<a name="ar218" id="ar218"></a></span> a town of northern France in the
department of Seine, situated on the right bank of the Marne, at
its confluence with the Seine, 1 m. S.E. of the fortifications of
Paris, of which it is a suburb. Pop. (1906) 18,034. It derives
the distinctive part of its name from the stone bridge of ten
arches which crosses the Marne and unites the town with Alfortville,
well known for its veterinary school founded in 1766. It
has always been regarded as a point of great importance for the
defence of the capital, and has frequently been the scene of
sanguinary conflicts. The fort of Charenton on the left bank
of the Marne is one of the older forts of the Paris defence. In the
16th and 17th centuries Charenton was the scene of the ecclesiastical
councils of the Protestant party, which had its principal
church in the town. At St Maurice adjoining Charenton is the
famous Hospice de Charenton, a lunatic asylum, the foundation
of which dates from 1641. Till the time of the Revolution it was
used as a general hospital, and even as a prison, but from 1802
onwards it was specially appropriated to the treatment of lunacy.
St Maurice has two other national establishments, one for the
victims of accidents in Paris (<i>asile national Vacassy</i>), the other
for convalescent working-men (<i>asile national de Vincennes</i>).
Charenton has a port on the Canal de St Maurice, beside the
Marne, and carries on boat-building and the manufacture of
tiles and porcelain.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHARES,<a name="ar219" id="ar219"></a></span> Athenian general, is first heard of in 366 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> as
assisting the Phliasians, who had been attacked by Argos and
Sicyon. In 361 he visited Corcyra, where he helped the
oligarchs to expel the democrats, a policy which led to the
subsequent defection of the island from Athens. In 357, Chares
was appointed to the command in the Social War, together with
Chabrias, after whose death before Chios he was associated with
Iphicrates and Timotheus (for the naval battle in the Hellespont,
see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Timotheus</a></span>). Chares, having successfully thrown the blame
for the defeat on his colleagues, was left sole commander, but
receiving no supplies from Athens, took upon himself to join the
revolted satrap Artabazus. A complaint from the Persian king,
who threatened to send three hundred ships to the assistance of
the confederates, led to the conclusion of peace (355) between
Athens and her revolted allies, and the recall of Chares. In 349, he
was sent to the assistance of Olynthus (<i>q.v.</i>) against Philip II. of
Macedon, but returned without having effected anything; in the
following year, when he reached Olynthus, he found it already
in the hands of Philip. In 340 he was appointed to the command
of a force sent to aid Byzantium against Philip, but the inhabitants,
remembering his former plunderings and extortions, refused
to receive him. In 338 he was defeated by Philip at Amphissa,
and was one of the commanders at the disastrous battle of
Chaeroneia. Lysicles, one of his colleagues, was condemned
to death, while Chares does not seem to have been even accused.
After the conquest of Thebes by Alexander (335), Chares is said
to have been one of the Athenian orators and generals whose
surrender was demanded. Two years later he was living at
Sigeum, for Arrian (<i>Anabasis</i> i. 12) states that he went from there
to pay his respects to Alexander. In 332 he entered the service
of Darius and took over the command of a Persian force in
Mytilene, but capitulated on the approach of a Macedonian fleet
on condition of being allowed to retire unmolested. He is last
heard of at Taenarum, and is supposed to have died at Sigeum.
Although boastful and vain-glorious, Chares was not lacking in
personal courage, and was among the best Athenian generals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page859" id="page859"></a>859</span>
of his time. At the best, however, he was &ldquo;hardly more than an
ordinary leader of mercenaries&rdquo; (A. Holm). He openly boasted
of his profligacy, was exceedingly avaricious, and his bad faith
became proverbial.</p>

for the Rhodians a colossal bronze statue of the sun-god, the cost
of which was defrayed by selling the warlike engines left behind
by Demetrius Poliorcetes, when he abandoned the siege of the
city in 303 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> (Pliny, <i>Nat. Hist.</i> xxxiv. 41). The colossus was
seventy cubits (105 ft.) in height; and its fingers were larger than
many statues. The notion that the legs were planted apart, so
that ships could sail between them, is absurd. The statue was
thrown down by an earthquake after 56 years; but the remains
lay for ages on the spot.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHARGE<a name="ar222" id="ar222"></a></span> (through the Fr. from the Late Lat. <i>carricare</i>, to
load in a <i>carrus</i> or wagon; cf. &ldquo;cargo&rdquo;), a load; from this, its
primary meaning, also seen in the word &ldquo;charger,&rdquo; a large dish,
come the uses of the word for the powder and shot to load a firearm,
the accumulation of electricity in a battery, the necessary
quantity of dynamite or other explosive in blasting, and a device
borne on an escutcheon in heraldry. &ldquo;Charge&rdquo; can thus mean
a burden, and so a care or duty laid upon one, as in &ldquo;to be in
charge&rdquo; of another. With a transference to that which lays such
a duty on another, &ldquo;charge&rdquo; is used of the instructions given by
a judge to a jury, or by a bishop to the clergy of his diocese. In
the special sense of a pecuniary burden the word is used of the
price of goods, of an encumbrance on property, and of the
expenses of running a business. Further uses of the word are of
the violent, rushing attack of cavalry, or of a bull or elephant, or
football player; hence &ldquo;charger&rdquo; is a horse ridden in a charge,
or more loosely a horse ridden by an officer, whether of infantry
or cavalry.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHARGÉ D&rsquo;AFFAIRES<a name="ar223" id="ar223"></a></span> (Fr. for &ldquo;in charge of business&rdquo;), the
title of two classes of diplomatic agents, (1) <i>Chargés d&rsquo;affaires</i>
(<i>ministres chargés d&rsquo;affaires</i>), who were placed by the <i>règlement</i>
of the congress of Vienna in the 4th class of diplomatic agents,
are heads of permanent missions accredited to countries to which,
for some reason, it is not possible or not desirable to send agents
of a higher rank. They are distinguished from these latter by the
fact that their credentials are addressed by the minister for
foreign affairs of the state which they are to represent to the
minister for foreign affairs of the receiving state. Though still
occasionally accredited, ministers of this class are now rare.
They have precedence over the other class of <i>chargés d&rsquo;affaires</i>.
(2) <i>Chargés d&rsquo;affaires per interim</i>, or <i>chargés des affaires</i>, are those
who are presented as such, either verbally or in writing, by heads
of missions of the first, second or third rank to the minister for
foreign affairs of the state to which they are accredited, when
they leave their post temporarily, or pending the arrival of their
successor. It is usual to appoint a counsellor or secretary of
legation <i>chargé d&rsquo;affaires</i>. Some governments are accustomed
to give the title of minister to such <i>chargés d&rsquo;affaires</i>, which
ranks them with the other heads of legation. Essentially
<i>chargés d&rsquo;affaires</i> do not differ from ambassadors, envoys or
ministers resident. They represent their nation, and enjoy the
same privileges and immunities as other diplomatic agents
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Diplomacy</a></span>).</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHARGING ORDER,<a name="ar224" id="ar224"></a></span> in English law, an order obtained from
a court or judge by a judgment creditor under the Judgment
Acts 1838 and 1840, by which the property of the judgment
debtor in any stocks or funds stands charged with the payment
of the amount for which judgment shall have been recovered,
with interest. A charging order can only be obtained in respect
of an ascertained sum, but this would include a sum ordered to be
paid at a future date. An order can be made on stock standing
in the name of a trustee in trust for the judgment debtor, or on
cash in court to the credit of the judgment debtor, but not on
stock held by a debtor as a trustee. The application for a charging
order is usually made by motion to a divisional court, though
it may be made to a judge. The effect of the order is not that of
a contract to pay the debt, but merely of an instrument of charge
on the shares, signed by the debtor. An interval of six months
must elapse before any proceedings are taken to enforce the
charge, but, it necessary, a stop order on the fund and the dividends
payable by the debtor can be obtained by the creditor
to protect his interest A solicitor employed to prosecute any
suit, matter or proceeding in any court, is entitled, on declaration
of the court, to a charge for his costs upon the property recovered
or preserved in such suit or proceeding. (See <i>Rules of the
Supreme Court</i>, o. XLIX.)</p>

between his sons, Charibert receiving Paris as his capital,
together with Rouen, Tours, Poitiers, Limoges, Bordeaux and
Toulouse. Besides his wife, Ingoberga, he had unions with
Merofleda, a wool-carder&rsquo;s daughter, and Theodogilda, the
daughter of a neatherd. He was one of the most dissolute of
the Merovingian kings, his early death in 567 being brought on

<p><span class="bold">CHARIDEMUS,<a name="ar226" id="ar226"></a></span> of Oreus in Euboea, Greek mercenary leader.
About 367 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> he fought under the Athenian general Iphicrates
against Amphipolis. Being ordered by Iphicrates to take the Amphipolitan
hostages to Athens, he allowed them to return to their own
people, and joined Cotys, king of Thrace, against Athens. Soon
afterwards he fell into the hands of the Athenians and accepted
the offer of Timotheus to re-enter their service. Having been
dismissed by Timotheus (362) he joined the revolted satraps
Memnon and Mentor in Asia, but soon lost their confidence, and
was obliged to seek the protection of the Athenians. Finding,
however, that he had nothing to fear from the Persians, he again
joined Cotys, on whose murder he was appointed guardian to his
youthful son Cersobleptes. In 357, on the arrival of Chares with
considerable forces, the Chersonese was restored to Athens. The
supporters of Charidemus represented this as due to his efforts,
and, in spite of the opposition of Demosthenes, he was honoured
with a golden crown and the franchise of the city. It was further
resolved that his person should be inviolable. In 351 he commanded
the Athenian forces in the Chersonese against Philip II.
of Macedon, and in 349 he superseded Chares as commander in
the Olynthian War. He achieved little success, but made himself
detested by his insolence and profligacy, and was in turn
replaced by Chares. After Chaeroneia the war party would
have entrusted Charidemus<a name="fa1j" id="fa1j" href="#ft1j"><span class="sp">1</span></a> with the command against Philip,
but the peace party secured the appointment of Phocion. He
was one of those whose surrender was demanded by Alexander
after the destruction of Thebes, but escaped with banishment.
He fled to Darius III., who received him with distinction. But,
having expressed his dissatisfaction with the preparations made
by the king just before the battle of Issus (333), he was put to
death.</p>
